It perfectly encapsulates all of the positivity associated with the spring and summer seasons. In this regard, it&amp;#039;s more reminiscent of the the more rhythmic Eating and Eating 2 releases than it is of his more experimental and atonal Pia and Opus Pia albums. The album has songs that are sometimes mostly piano-based and even one featuring David Sylvian (on &quot;Exit/Delete&quot;). Even though Masakatsu&amp;#039;s aural works are mostly concentrated within the realm of electronic music, it&amp;#039;s an album that&amp;#039;s more contingent on the listener&amp;#039;s mood than their genre preference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d9ef6612d504ff9c6f454f83c2679c96bcc854","amp;dn":"Takagi+Masakatsu+-+COIEDA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d9ef6612d504ff9c6f454f83c2679c96bcc854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,217,239,102,18,213,4,255,156,111,69,79,131,194,103,156,150,188,200,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

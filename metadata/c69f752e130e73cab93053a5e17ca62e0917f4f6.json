The play, partially written by GrouchoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son Arthur, portrays Grouch from his earliest vaudeville days to just before his death in 1977. It features a good deal of improvisation, as well as productions of the most famous Marx Brothers bits. This show is simply fantastic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ show it to your friends who hate theater, even they will have to admit it is drop dead funny.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nJulius Henry &quot;Groucho&quot; Marx (October 2, 1890 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ August 19, 1977), was an American comedian and film star. He is famed as a master of wit. He made 13 feature films with his siblings, the Marx Brothers, and also had a successful solo career, most notably as the host of the radio and television game show You Bet Your Life. He had a distinctive image, which included a heavy greasepaint moustache and eyebrows and glasses.\n\nGroucho Marx made a total of 26 movies; of them, thirteen were with his brothers Chico and Harpo.[2] Marx developed a routine as a wise-cracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint moustache and eyebrows, and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy dowagers (often played by Margaret Dumont) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of extraordinarily popular stage shows and movies.\n\nTheir first movie was a silent film made in 1919 that was never released,[2] and believed to have been destroyed at the time. A decade later, the team made some of their Broadway hits into movies, including The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).[2] Other successful films were Monkey Business (1931), Horse Feathers (1932), Duck Soup (1933) and A Night at the Opera (1935).[2] One quip from Marx concerned his response to Sam Wood, the director of the classic film A Night at the Opera. Wood was furious with the Marx Brothers' ad-libs and antics on the set and yelled to all in disgust that he &quot;cannot make actors out of clay.&quot; Without missing a beat, Groucho responded, &quot;Nor can you make a director out of Wood.&quot;\n\nMarx also worked as a radio comedian and show host. One of his earliest stints was in a short-lived series in 1932 Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, co-starring Chico, who was the only one of his brothers also willing to appear on the show. Most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, but all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the Library of Congress.\n\nIn 1947, Marx was chosen to host a radio quiz program You Bet Your Life broadcast by ABC and then CBS, before moving over to NBC television in 1950. Filmed before a live audience, the television show consisted of Marx interviewing the contestants and ad libbing jokes, before playing a brief quiz. The show was responsible for the phrases &quot;Say the secret woid [word] and divide $100&quot; (that is, each contestant would get $50); and &quot;Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?&quot; or &quot;What color is the White House?&quot; (asked when Marx felt sorry for a contestant who had not won anything). It ran for eleven years on television.\n\nGroucho was also the subject of urban legend, pertaining to a supposed response to a contestant who had over a dozen children which supposedly brought down the house. In response to Marx asking in disbelief why she had so many children, the contestant replied &quot;No, Groucho. You don't understand. I really, really love my husband.&quot;, to which Marx responded, &quot;I love my cigar too, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.&quot; Groucho often asserted in interviews that this exchange in fact never took place, but it remains one of the most oft quoted &quot;Groucho-isms&quot; nonetheless.\n\nThroughout his career he introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot;, in Animal Crackers, &quot;Whatever It Is, I'm Against It&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; and &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot;. Frank Sinatra, who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and Jane Russell in 1951 entitled Double Dynamite.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69f752e130e73cab93053a5e17ca62e0917f4f6","amp;dn":"Live+On+Broadway+-+Groucho+-+A+Life+In+Revue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69f752e130e73cab93053a5e17ca62e0917f4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,159,117,46,19,14,115,202,185,48,83,165,225,124,166,46,9,23,244,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

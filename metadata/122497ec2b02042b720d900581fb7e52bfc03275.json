Andy LaRocque made a great job on the production and the mastering along with Olof Berggren. It's upright and powerful. We feel very proud of what we achieved on this recording and merely the sound of it makes it a worthy follow-up to the firstborn 'Fi'mbulvintr'. Songs and sounds came out much as of what we planned, with power and a great variety. 'Ã¢â‚¬Â¦To North' takes off pretty much where 'Fi'mbulvintr' left off so to say, with a natural development, more varied songs and structures. It's a development of our sound which will be recognized by old fans as well as bring some new ones to the horde. This time around I've been more involved in the writing process along with Karl, which kind of shines through, giving the songs a wider perspective. Expect some very strong songs on 'Ã¢â‚¬Â¦To North', where epic meets with brutality! The lyrical theme this time is basically in the same vein but has different twists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122497ec2b02042b720d900581fb7e52bfc03275","amp;dn":"King+Of+Asgard+-+Vinterskugge%28To+North..%29++mp3++320k+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122497ec2b02042b720d900581fb7e52bfc03275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,36,151,236,43,2,4,43,114,13,144,5,129,251,126,82,191,192,50,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

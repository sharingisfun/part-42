With the combination of both visual and sound effects, you can produce very realistic animated nature scenes such as waterfalls, lakes, or seas. Finally you can save your creation as screensavers, executables, animated GIF's, or AVI's and share it to your friends.\n\nMake photo live\nA photo restricts your excitement from holidays spent at the seaside or near a waterfall to flat, two-dimensional images. Nature Illusion Studio lets you go beyond these physical restrictions and make a self-made animated scene, which can bring the original spirit and excitement of the holiday back to life.\n\nRealistic natural effects\nAll visual effects have been recreated with accurate physics, so ripples on the water or subtle movements of the air look and behave just like they might in the physical life.\n\nShare to others\nThe best thing is that you can share your excitement with others. You can create a screensaver and present it as a gift to your beloved or friend, publish it on your website and let your guests or customers download it for free.\n\nSuperb result\nThe end result is a superbly lifelike and atmospheric presentation that can be saved as a screensaver, a standalone executable, an AVI or animated GIF file and distributed to other people, who can admire your creation.\n\nFeatures:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Apply up to 6 water effects to a single image.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Add Animated Objects to image.

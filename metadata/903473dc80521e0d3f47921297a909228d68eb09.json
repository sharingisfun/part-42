In the early sixties\nhe recorded a string of teenage anthems such as Calendar Girl,\nHappy Birthday Sweet Sixteen and Breaking up is Hard to Do.\n\nThe arrival of the Beatles on the musical landscape signalled the\nend of Sedaka's singing career and he turned to writing songs for\nother artists such as the Monkees, Tom Jones and Tony Christie.\nBut a move to England in the early 1970s was the launch pad for a\nremarkable comeback. He recorded with British band 10cc in Stockport\nbefore returning to the top of the American charts with Laughter\nin the Rain and Bad Blood.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 70, Sedaka still has a huge following. He\ntoured the UK to packed houses and released a new album, The Music\nof My Life. Singers Tony Christie and Connie Francis, musicians\nGraham Gouldman of 10cc and Jay Siegel of the Tokens, and Brill\nBuilding songwriting colleagues Don Kirshner and Carol Bayer Sager\nare among those paying tribute to the 'king of doobie-dos'.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/j0QxS.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/j0QxS.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/jSWjg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/jSWjg.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/ecZIS.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/ecZIS.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 636 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 506 Kbps\nDuration: 59mn 5s\nSample: No\nSubtitles: No\n\n\nContainer: avc1\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 400 Kbps / 1 400 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.194\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: me\n\n\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 160 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903473dc80521e0d3f47921297a909228d68eb09","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Legends+Neil+Sedaka+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903473dc80521e0d3f47921297a909228d68eb09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,52,115,220,128,82,30,13,63,71,146,18,151,169,9,34,141,104,235,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

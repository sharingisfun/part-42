For example, if your character was born a girl in India, a database of Indian girl's names would be consulted as well as a database of Indian last names, Indian cities, Indian health statistics, etc. \n\nThroughout the game player's lives can be affected by random events such as floods, outbreaks of war, disease, car accidents and other major life changing events. Players get to play from the moment of birth until they die.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n1) Install\n2) Use serial when asked","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efb13c27e7b0d190136b5d6d9f54b2ac77729cb","amp;dn":"Real+Lives+2007+with+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efb13c27e7b0d190136b5d6d9f54b2ac77729cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,251,19,194,126,123,13,25,1,54,181,214,217,245,75,42,199,119,41,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

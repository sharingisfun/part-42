His music is great. If nothing else you need to check out the cover of Never Gonna Give You Up. It has Toby Keith on vocals and is nothing short of amazing.\n\n2004 - Hang Time\n2006 - Way Up\n2008 - Rebound\n\nNot only was Wayman a very talented guy, both in music and sports. Many say he was a great man as well. Lets just be glad he is in a better place. I'm sure he's still jamming\n\nIf you like the music donate a few bucks to waymans foundation or another cancer society.\n\nI'm really disappointed I couldn't make the funeral myself because of work but you can watch it on the local fox stations website\nhttp://www.fox23.com/mediacenter/local.aspx?videoId=&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f0c3c8c8c7c7b09b9f9b99de949189809f8284de939f9d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&amp;navCatId=8135\n\nIt includes a performance by Toby Keith and another by Marcus Miller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34a0896f8dcd5332e91e1b968db8ab441058537a","amp;dn":"Wayman+Tisdale+3+Albums+in+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34a0896f8dcd5332e91e1b968db8ab441058537a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,160,137,111,141,205,83,50,233,30,27,150,141,184,171,68,16,88,83,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

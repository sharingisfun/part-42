Johnny Mercer and Gene de Paul wrote the score as a followup to their rustic Hollywood hit, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; and the show ran in New York for two years. It was based, of course, on the Al Capp comic strip, which had been running for 20 years and was still very popular in the 1950s. The musical numbers remain enjoyable and though times have changes since the Eisenhower era, the satirical jabs at the government, politicals, bureaucrats and corporate fat cats still have an edge. Released in 1959, the movie and &quot;Funny Face&quot; would prove to be among the last big musicals Paramount would produce in the Golden Age of Movie Musicals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72567e7280cf006c8609e44042512f1fa16709c6","amp;dn":"Lil+Abner+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72567e7280cf006c8609e44042512f1fa16709c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,86,126,114,128,207,0,108,134,9,228,64,66,81,47,31,161,103,9,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

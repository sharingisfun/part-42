In addition, we explore Maryam?s character, whom Allah raised above all other women, and thereby define the ideal Muslim woman?s character. As a result of this analysis, we will see that this superiority is only in terms of  faith, fear and respect of  Allah, and fine character, and that every man or woman who does good deeds will be justly rewarded with Allah?s good pleasure, mercy, and Paradise, as mentioned below: ?Anyone, male or female, who does right actions and believes, will enter the Garden. They will not be wronged by so much as the tiniest speck?

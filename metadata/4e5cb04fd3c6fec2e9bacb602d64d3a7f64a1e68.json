Only the Professional Edition offers the breadth of advanced optimization, multi-threading, and processor support that includes automatic processor dispatch, vectorization, auto-parallelization, OpenMP*, data prefetching, and loop unrolling, along with highly optimized C++ templates for parallelism, math processing, and multimedia libraries.\n\n\nThe Professional Edition combines a high performance compiler with IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Threading Building Blocks (IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® TBB), IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Integrated Performance Primitives (IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® IPP) and IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Math Kernel Library (IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MKL). While these libraries are available separately, the Professional Edition creates a strong foundation for building robust, high performance parallel code at significant price savings.\n\n\nNew:\nIntel Compiler Suite Professional Edition for Windows. This suite includes all the features of the Intel C++ Compiler Professional Edition, but also includes the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows for a more complete solution at significant price savings.\n\nPerformance:\nConsider the Intel C++ Compiler Professional Edition to maximize performance. The built-in optimization technologies and multi-threading support help create code that runs best on the latest multi-core processors.\n\nAdvanced Optimization Features:\nSoftware compiled using the Intel C++ Compilers for Windows benefits from advanced optimization features, a few of which are explained briefly here, with links to more complete descriptions:\n\n&gt;&gt; Multi-Threaded Application Support, including OpenMP and auto-parallelization for simple and efficient software threading.\n&gt;&gt; Auto-vectorization parallelizes code to utilize the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instruction set architectures (SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, and SSE4) of our latest processors.\n\n&gt;&gt; High-Performance Parallel Optimizer (HPO) restructures and optimizes loops to ensure that auto-vectorization, OpenMP, or auto-parallelization best utilizes the processorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capabilities for cache and memory accesses, SIMD instruction sets, and for multiple cores. This revolutionary capability, new in version 10, combines vectorization, parallelization and loop transformations into a single pass which is faster, more effective and more reliable than prior discrete phases.\n\n&gt;&gt; Interprocedural Optimization (IPO) dramatically improves performance of small- or medium-sized functions that are used frequently, especially programs that contain calls within loops. The analysis capabilities of this optimizer can also give feedback on vulnerabilities and coding errors, such as uninitialized variables or OpenMP API issues, which cannot be detected as well by compilers which rely strictly on analysis by a compiler front-end.\n\n&gt;&gt; Profile-guided Optimization (PGO) improves application performance by reducing instruction-cache thrashing, reorganizing code layout, shrinking code size, and reducing branch mispredictions.\n\n&gt;&gt; Optimized Code Debugging with the IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Debugger improves the efficiency of the debugging process on code that has been optimized for IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® architecture.\n\n\n\nscanned with kaspersky -  clean\nmbam scan - Malwarebytes&amp;#039; Anti-Malware 1.28\nDatabase version: 1201\nWindows 6.0.6000 \n\n10/5/2008 3:43:33 PM\nmbam-log-2008-10-05 (15-43-33).txt\n\nScan type: Quick Scan\nObjects scanned: 1\nTime elapsed: 7 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e5cb04fd3c6fec2e9bacb602d64d3a7f64a1e68","amp;dn":"Intel+C%2B%2B+Compiler+v10.1.014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e5cb04fd3c6fec2e9bacb602d64d3a7f64a1e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,92,176,79,211,198,254,194,233,186,203,96,45,100,211,167,246,74,30,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

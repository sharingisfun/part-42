J. Simpson.\n\nSYNOPSIS: When a plague-infected terrorist, fleeing from the police, exposes the 1,000 riders of the Geneva to Stockholm Express, Colonel MacKenzie (Burt Lancaster) is called in to handle the situation. He locates a doctor aboard the train, Jonathan Chamberlain (Richard Harris) who, with his wife (Sophia Loren), finds the fugitive. They attempt to transfer him to a hovering helicopter, but fail, and the terrorist dies. To prevent the spread of the plague, Colonel MacKenzie directs the train to the Cassandra Crossing where it will plunge into oblivion, killing all aboard. At Nuremberg, the train is pumped with oxygen and the stricken passengers begin to recover. Dr. Chamberlain argues that they can be spared, but Colonel MacKenzie refuses, and as the train rushes toward the collapsing Cassandra Crossing bridge, Chamberlain struggles to disconnect the cars and save the passengers from their appointment with doom. \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nResolution: 640X480\nAudio: 448kbps\nRunning Time: 123 minutes\nQuality: download the sample to see the quality of the picture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d14682fbadb9fefd7fd97ce3cbd7e0aa0cadc4d4","amp;dn":"The.Cassandra.Crossing.1976.DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d14682fbadb9fefd7fd97ce3cbd7e0aa0cadc4d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,70,130,251,173,185,254,253,127,217,124,227,203,215,224,170,12,173,196,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Uk: Harry, He's Here to Help) is a French film released in 2000. It was directed by Dominik Moll.\n\n Laurent Lucas ...  Michel \n Sergi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez ...

Iris \n\nIf David Lynch had a French half-brother he might have made &quot;With a Friend Like Harry.&quot; It's a strangely colored macabre thriller, directed by Dominik Moll and written by Gilles Marchand and Moll. The story is about a well-to-do guy, Harry (Sergi Lopez), who insinuates himself and his girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), into the lives of a middle-class family -- Michel, his wife, Claire, and their three little daughters -- after the two men meet in a roadside men's room. Harry's apparent motive is to help his old pal Michel, with whom he claims to have gone to high school. (Michel never really remembers Harry.) \n\nHarry begins trying to solve Michel's problems. The family's car breaks down, so Harry buys them a new SUV. He offers to drive Claire home from grocery shopping in his Mercedes. He urges Michel to write again, as he did in high school. \n\nAnd then things get weird. The plot twists that follow are Hitchcockian, but these are less intrinsic to the movie's intents than the bizarre moments and intermittent disturbing humor\n\n\nAcademy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA \n2002  Nominated Saturn Award Best DVD Release \n\n\nBAFTA Awards \n\n2001  Nominated BAFTA Film Award Best Film not in the English Language Michel Saint-Jean Dominik Moll  \n\nBratislava International Film Festival \n2000  Nominated Grand Prix Dominik Moll  \n\nCannes Film Festival \n2000  Nominated Golden Palm Dominik Moll  \n\nCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Awards, France \n2001  Won CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Actor (Meilleur acteur) Sergi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez \n2001  Won CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Director (Meilleur rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©alisateur) Dominik Moll \n2001  Won CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Editing (Meilleur montage) Yannick Kergoat \n2001  Won CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Sound (Meilleur son) FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Maurel GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Lamps GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Hardy  \n2001  Nominated CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Film (Meilleur film) Dominik Moll \n2001  Nominated CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Music Written for a Film (Meilleure musique) David Whitaker \n2001  Nominated CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Supporting Actress (Meilleur second rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´le fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©minin) Mathilde Seigner \n2001  Nominated CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Best Writing - Original or Adaptation (Meilleur scÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nario, original ou adaptation) Dominik Moll Gilles Marchand \n2001  Nominated CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Most Promising Actress (Meilleur espoir fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©minin) Sophie Guillemin  \n\nEuropean Film Awards \n2000  Won European Film Award Best Actor Sergi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez  \n2000  Nominated European Film Award Best Film Michel Saint-Jean \n2000  Nominated European Film Award Best Screenwriter Dominik Moll Gilles Marchand  \n\nLondon Critics Circle Film Awards \n2001  Nominated ALFS Award Foreign Language Film of the Year \n\nOnline Film Critics Society Awards \n2002  Nominated OFCS Award Best Foreign Language Film \n\nPhoenix Film Critics Society Awards \n2002  Nominated PFCS Award Best Foreign Language Film \n\nSan Diego International Film Festival \n2001  Won Festival Award Best Feature Film Dominik Moll  \n\nSant Jordi Awards \n2001  Won Sant Jordi Best Spanish Actor (Mejor Actor EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol) Sergi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez Also for Une liaison pornographique (1999). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27879df2d52995d18577a1a2d510bc934ab99820","amp;dn":"Harry+un+ami+qui+vous+veut+du+bien+%28multisubs%29++%5B2000%5D+Dominik+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27879df2d52995d18577a1a2d510bc934ab99820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,135,157,242,213,41,149,209,133,119,161,162,213,16,188,147,74,185,152,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

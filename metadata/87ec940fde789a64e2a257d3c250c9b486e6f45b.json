Somerset Maugham, such as the British sent over to us last year under the enumerative title of &quot;Quartet,&quot; has been whipped up by the same people who produced that other oneÃ¢â‚¬â€Sydney Box and his staff, at Gainsborough PicturesÃ¢â‚¬â€and considerately sent along. This one is titled &quot;Trio&quot; and it opened at the Sutton yesterday. Unless something cataclysmic happens, it is doomed to enjoy a large success.\n\nFor &quot;Trio,&quot; just like its predecessor, which played at the Sutton for eight months, is a wonderfully rich and assorted demonstration of characters involved in situations of amusing and challenging vein. Just like its predecessorÃ¢â‚¬â€and like the stories of Mr. Maugham, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€it is shot through with keen, ironic humor and subtle mockery of the stuffier British types. And even more so than &quot;Quartet,&quot; it has a fluid consistency of style and a quality of light sophistication that fully flatters and flips the adult mind.\n\nThis is the more fascinating, from a critical point of view, because the three tales presented in this medley are actually slighter than those in &quot;Quartet.&quot; Indeed, the first two are no more than character vignettes, crisply topped off with witty comment in little sardonic &quot;twists&quot; at the end. And the third one is simply a study of a group of patients tucked away in a tuberculosis sanitorium in Scotland which is brought to a climax in a bravely dared romance. But the concept and execution of all three items are so thoughtful and adroit that they add up to entertainment which is quite as &quot;filling&quot; as that of a full-length yarn.\n\nPropitiously, in this case, it is virtually impossible to say which is the best of the items, so perfect in its special frame is each. The first of the lot is &quot;The Verger,&quot; a whimsical and satiric vignette, based on a story of Mr. Maugham's called &quot;The Man Who Made His Mark.&quot; It tells very simply of the verger of a fashionable London church who is &quot;sacked&quot; and goes on to make a fortune because he couldn't read or write. Within it, however, is a vast lot of laughter at social pretense, and it is beautifully played by a fine cast which has James Hayter in the principal role.\n\n&quot;Mr. Know-All,&quot; the second item, is equally modest and terse, but quite as revealing of character in a somewhat more acid vein. The central figure in this case is an insufferably immodest man Ã¢â‚¬â€ a bashless buttinsky and bounderÃ¢â‚¬â€who becomes the bore of the British passengers on an ocean trip. But, in a fashion which it would be unfair to tell you, he reveals that he does have a curious chivalry. Nigel Patrick plays this creature with uncommon force and clarity, and Anne Crawford is lovely as the lady whom he defends.\n\nThe last of the lot, called &quot;Sanitorium,&quot; is considerably broader in its sweep and achieves some general comprehension of the pathos of a medical irony. In fact, the theme of this story is the effect which a tedious illness has upon people of different calibreÃ¢â‚¬â€how it brings out the weaknesses in some, such as the petty grousers and escapists in this fable, and how it strengthens and ennobles a few. The ones who face fate with strength and courage here are a beautiful young woman and an erstwhile rake, thrown together by chance at the sanitorium and precipitated into a radiant love.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this latter item was considered at one time, we are told, as the stuff for a full-length picture, and well it might have been. But told as it is in this instance, it is brilliantly concise and emotionally full. It is, indeed, this fine economy of expression which is one of the great charms of the whole film. Nothing is obviously labored. Points are made with exquisite clarity but often with the slightest of suggestion. This is a mark of the story-teller's art.\n\nWe must add that in the final item Jean Simmons glows with beauty and feminine grace as the girl who elects to be married rather than drag out her life in sickness' clutch, and Michael Rennie is magnificently stalwart as the guardsman who offers her a few brief months of love. Finlay Currie, Raymond Huntley and John Laurie are sure as other characters in this sketch. Harold French directed this item and Ken Annakin directed the other two.\n\nMr. Maugham himself appears briefly to introduce each tale, not as the guardian of his stories, for they are in eminently talented hands.\n\nAlso on the bill at the Sutton is a British Crown Film unit short, entitled &quot;Trooping the Colour,&quot; which records in brilliant and stirring style the traditional ceremony of trooping the colorÃ¢â‚¬â€by the Welsh Guards, in this caseÃ¢â‚¬â€on the King's birthday. It makes an oddly appropriate bit of atmosphere to accompany the urbane British stories of Mr. Maugham.\n\nTRIO, from three short stories by W. Somerset Maugham. Screen play by Mr. Maugham, R. C. Sherriff and Noel Langley; directed by Ken Annakin and Harold French; produced by Anthony Darnborough; a Sydney Box Production and a Gainsborough Picture, released here by Paramount.

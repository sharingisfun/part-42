After years without rain, all animals have left the idyllic island one by one. Meanwhile, the whole flora has dried up.\n\n\nBut Nanda refuses to give up and has made it his objective to save the island with his shamanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge and transform it back into the paradise it used to be. The young pandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s specialty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alas, it is also the only ritual he has mastered yet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is his rain dance. With that dance he wants to supply the island with sufficient water.\n\nUnfortunately, the young shamanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s abilities are still lacking in many ways, so he is only able to summon a rather small cloud so far. This can be used for selective watering only. Even worse, this cloud often appears where the water is not needed.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/Win7\nCPU: 1.2 GHz\nRAM: 512 MB\nDirectX: 9.0\nHard Drive: 86 MB\n\n[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6220066164_772219e548.jpg[/img]\n\nWork like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching\n- Unknown Author -\n\nAnd Seed like there is no bandwith limit :)\n\nSupport Us\nYour &quot;Thank You&quot; means a lot\n\n[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5841348205_e896fe6f30.jpg[/img]\n\nTHANKS TO LeeGT\n\nAnd Let's never forget the work of Flight of the Conchords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7606947a7d45a1cfd7ea5ad4b344c3bc628597","amp;dn":"Nanda%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+Island+-+NEW+KIDS+GAME+%5BAllSmartGames%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e7606947a7d45a1cfd7ea5ad4b344c3bc628597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,118,6,148,122,125,69,161,207,215,234,90,212,179,68,195,188,98,133,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

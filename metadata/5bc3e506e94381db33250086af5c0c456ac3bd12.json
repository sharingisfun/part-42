Irene Papas appears as Clytemnestra.  Pappas \r\nas Elektra by Sophocles and  directed by Cacoyannis is also in my group file \r\nshares on TPB under loninappleton.\r\n\r\n   The style of the film is idyllic rather than stark for most of the film.  It has the sweep and large historical canvas of more popular dramas of the period and was released by MGM. \r\n\r\n   The subtitles contain the translation to English of the play, not the normal dialog of a modern day version of historical drama.\r\n\r\n   Though I have scant knowledge of Greek drama I have become familiar with the \r\nwork of Brian Doeries translations.  Doeries was trained in the classics and has \r\na volume of translations newly published (2016)  called &quot;All That You See Here Is \r\nGod.&quot;  I note them not for a translation of Iphigenia but for what Doeries brings as a modern translator to the work.  \r\n\r\n   The selectable subtitles are accessed through your media player such as VLC by \r\nVideolan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc3e506e94381db33250086af5c0c456ac3bd12","amp;dn":"Iphigenia+by+Euripides+%281977%29+dir+Michael+Cacoyannis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc3e506e94381db33250086af5c0c456ac3bd12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,195,229,6,233,67,129,219,51,37,0,134,175,92,12,69,106,195,189,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

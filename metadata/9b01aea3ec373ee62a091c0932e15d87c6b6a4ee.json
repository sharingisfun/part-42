Aria, Emily and Spencer seem to be up to something, but she can't quite seem to figure out what it is. But what Hanna may take as the cold shoulder, could really be just a case of guilty consciences from her friends. And if her best friends avoiding her weren't enough, Kate's first day at Rosewood High is looming. Now that her evil step-sister is invading Hanna's space, she needs her friends more than ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b01aea3ec373ee62a091c0932e15d87c6b6a4ee","amp;dn":"Pretty.Little.Liars.S02E18.HDTV.XviD-ASAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b01aea3ec373ee62a091c0932e15d87c6b6a4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,1,174,163,236,55,62,230,42,9,28,9,50,225,93,135,198,182,164,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

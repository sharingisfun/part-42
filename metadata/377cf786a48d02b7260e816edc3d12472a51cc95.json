It was released in Canada on October 17, 2006,in two formats: as a limited edition Digipak and regular jewel case. The United States release is set for March 6, 2007, in advance of a planned tour. This album was recorded at various locations including Maui, Vancouver and Toronto. In concert Gord Downie joked that the title of the album is actually a typo, and should read &quot;World Contain Her.&quot;\n\nThe first single, &quot;In View,&quot; and the video for the song, were released on the band&amp;#039;s website, thehip.com, in advance of the album release.\n\nThe track &quot;The Lonely End of the Rink&quot; was premiered on Hockey Night In Canada on October 7, to acclaim by fans of the band.\n\nThe album&amp;#039;s fourth track, &quot;Fly&quot; has been in the works since before the band recorded their Nov. 26, 2004 show at the Air Canada Centre, which became the concert DVD, &quot;That Night in Toronto.&quot; As can be witnessed on the DVD, Gord Downie recites the opening lyric of &quot;Fly&quot;, as well as a portion of the chorus, as a part of his rant during the extended up-tempo break of &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian.&quot;\n\nThe length of the CD is erroneously noted as &quot;42:45&quot; (min:sec) on the front and back cover. It is actually 42:27 (min:sec), or 42.45 minutes in length.\n\nWorld Container was streaming from thehip.com, the band&amp;#039;s official website, and various other Southern Ontario radio stations on October 10, 2006, one week ahead of the album release.\n\n\nAll songs were written by The Tragically Hip.\n\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n&quot;In View&quot; \n&quot;The Lonely End of the Rink&quot; \n&quot;Yer Not The Ocean&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377cf786a48d02b7260e816edc3d12472a51cc95","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+2006+-+World+Container","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377cf786a48d02b7260e816edc3d12472a51cc95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,124,247,134,164,141,2,183,38,14,129,110,220,61,18,71,42,81,204,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

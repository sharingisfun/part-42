Judy (Edie Falco) is an aspiring actress who is quitting her job as a &quot;pilgrim&quot; in a local historical museum's display to take her chances in Los Angeles. Her mother is a gifted but bitter schoolteacher (Barbara Barrie) who has long loved principal Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy) from afar. However, Arthur has a wife, Alice (Madeline Kahn), who's more than a bit eccentric and has driven him to distraction. Arthur and Alice have a son, David (Aaron Harnick), who like Judy has showbiz aspirations (he wants to be a filmmaker), though unlike Judy he has no idea of what to do about it; when Judy and David meet, could romance be lurking around the corner? First-time director Eric Mendelsohn has equipped this offbeat comic drama an outstanding cast, which also includes Julie Kavner, Anne Meara, and Novella Nelson.\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 1h 31mn\nBit rate                                 : 2 600 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 024 pixels\nHeight                                   : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\n\nAudio\nCodec ID                                 : A_MPEG/L3\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eca8c0208269028670bfd8042e5d48abd657746","amp;dn":"Judy+Berlin+%281999%29%2C+Eric+Mendelsohn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eca8c0208269028670bfd8042e5d48abd657746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,202,140,2,8,38,144,40,103,11,253,128,66,229,212,138,189,101,119,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Or how a drug that is pulled off the market for causing heart attacks ever got approved in the first place? How can average readers, who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t medical doctors or Ph.D.s in biochemistry, tell what they should be paying attention to and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, well, just more bullshit?\n\nBen Goldacre has made a point of exposing quack doctors and nutritionists, bogus credentialing programs, and biased scientific studies. He has also taken the media to task for its willingness to throw facts and proof out the window. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not here just to tell you whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong. Goldacre is here to teach you how to evaluate placebo effects, double-blind studies, and sample sizes, so that you can recognize bad science when you see it. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to feel a whole lot better.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f47d2dafbcf40cd07c44e19042030ba7fcaf2e3d","amp;dn":"Bad+Science%3A+Quacks%2C+Hacks%2C+and+Big+Pharma+Flacks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f47d2dafbcf40cd07c44e19042030ba7fcaf2e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,125,45,175,188,244,12,208,124,68,225,144,66,3,11,167,252,175,46,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

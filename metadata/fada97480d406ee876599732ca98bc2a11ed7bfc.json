Try again or if it becomes intolerable use the Alternative Loader.\nTo use the alternative loader jar files must be associated with java.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nHere is my updated Minecraft torrent for 1.8.1\n\nChanged this version:\nVersion 2.1.0\nFor Minecraft 1.8.1\nEarly Vertsion - Not including most mods and options.\nChanged distance for single player mining/placing from 32 blocks to 6 blocks (Vanilla Game has it set to 4)\nAdded another 256MB memory for the game to use\nAdded the HD texture pack fixer, now you can install HD textures\nRe-Added the resources to the game (Sounds etc) as i realised they only download themselves with a legitemate version of the game\n\nAs nobody seemed to read the readme i will keep this small.\nAlso, this is not the final relese of 1.8.x from me, but a version to keep you all happy while i wait for all the mods to be updated and to make sure a 1.8.2/.3 is not going to ruing all the work it takes to get the mods to cooperate.\n\nThis version includes basic unmodded minecraft, and a version with a few basic mods. The mods are as follows;\n\nTooManyItems\nZombe's Modpack\nHD Texture pack Fixer\nModloader is included.\n\nThe 'Unlicenced Copy' text remover is not included in this version, because it causes the game to crash when loaded with the loader. I will look for a new version, in the mean time you will just have to put up with it.\n\nThe controlls for basic minecraft are in the controlls section in 'Options'. Other Controlls (For the modded version only) are below:\n\nF = Fly On/Off\nE = Fly Up\nQ = Fly Down\nLSHIFT = Fly/walk faster (different from 1.8's sprint feature)\nF6 = NoClip while flying (SSP/CSP ONLY)\nBackspace = Path tracker (See where you have walked)\nNumpad + = Advance Sun Time\nNumpad - = Detract Sun Time\nEND = Stop Time (Freeze Sun in place)\nHOME = Normalize and Resume time\nL = Shows where Hostile Mobs can spawn (Yellow = Night only, Red = Anytime)\nO (in the inventory) = Enables/Disables TooManyItems\n\nAlso please vote here: http://www.acepolls.com/polls/1230772-what-mods-do-you-want-to-keephave-in-my-torrent/ For the mods you would like me to put back int my final 1.8 version, and also for some mods that i might add.

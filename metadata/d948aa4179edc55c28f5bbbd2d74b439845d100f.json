From there the album morphs into a number of new forms, into smoke-ring guitar solos and phasing electronic atmospherics. It retains all of the appeal of the debut but feels like a mutation of it more than a specific growth or refutation; the transition between the two has the feel of a roadtrip from the countryside to the city. The company remains constant, and good. It says something about the delicacy of that first release that the opening guitar lines of a track like &quot;Show Your Hand&quot; feel almost psychedelic, and the shift to a martial verse right afterward seems outright daring. But despite these instrumental differences, Collette's voice remains as lyrically and emotively appealing as ever, at once elliptic and conversational. By creating a work so artistically true to its predecessor but sonically expanded, Collette handily sidesteps any question of a sophomore slump.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d948aa4179edc55c28f5bbbd2d74b439845d100f","amp;dn":"Ned+Collette+-+Future+Suture+%5B2007%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d948aa4179edc55c28f5bbbd2d74b439845d100f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,72,170,65,121,237,197,92,40,245,187,189,45,116,180,57,132,93,16,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

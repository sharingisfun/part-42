It is the second 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise and sixth original title overall. It debuted in North America on October 29, 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and was later ported to the Xbox, and Microsoft Windows in 2003. It was made available on Steam on January 4, 2008, and on the Mac App Store on August 25, 2011.[3] A Nintendo GameCube version was planned, but was never released. Vice City was preceded by Grand Theft Auto III and followed by Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\nVice City draws much of its inspiration from 1980s American culture. Set in 1986 in Vice City, a fictional city modeled after Miami, the story revolves around Mafia hitman Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison. After being involved in a drug deal gone wrong, Tommy seeks out those responsible while building a criminal empire and seizing power from other criminal organizations in the city. The game uses a tweaked version of the game engine used in Grand Theft Auto III and similarly presents a huge cityscape, fully populated with buildings, vehicles, and people. Like other games in the series, Vice City has elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features an open world gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience.\nUpon its release, Vice City became the best-selling video game of 2002. In July 2006, Vice City was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. Vice City also appeared on Japanese magazine Famitsu's readers' list of the favorite 100 videogames of 2006, the only fully Western title on the list.[4] Following this success, Vice City saw releases in Europe, Australia and Japan, as well as a release for the PC. Rockstar Vienna also packaged the game with its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto III, and sold it as Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack for the Xbox. Vice City's setting is also revisited in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, which serves as a prequel to events in Vice City. In December 2012, Rockstar released Vice City for iOS and Android platforms as celebration for the game's 10th anniversary.\nThe soundtrack to the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City consists of music played on the various in-game radio stations the player can tune into after entering most types of cars and motorcycles, but it has also been released in a box set of seven separate CDs (dubbed the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set), with the European editions of the CDs containing a few extra songs that are not on the United States edition.\nMost radio stations play a mixture of music, DJ chat, and spoof advertising, all of which are included on the CDs. The stations each reflect one style of music intended to evoke the atmosphere of the time.\n\nEmotion 98.3\n\n\nEmotion 98.3 logo\nDJ: Fernando Martinez\nGenre: Power ballad, Rock\nTracklist:\nForeigner - &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;\nKate Bush - &quot;Wow&quot;[a]\nSqueeze - &quot;Tempted&quot;\nREO Speedwagon - &quot;Keep on Loving You&quot;\nCutting Crew - &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;\nRoxy Music - &quot;More Than This&quot;\nToto - &quot;Africa&quot;\nMr. Mister - &quot;Broken Wings&quot;\nJohn Waite - &quot;Missing You&quot;\nJan Hammer - &quot;Crockett's Theme&quot;\nNight Ranger - &quot;Sister Christian&quot;\nLuther Vandross - &quot;Never Too Much&quot;\n\nRadio Espantoso\nDJ: Pepe\nGenre: Latin jazz, salsa\nTracklist:\nCachao - &quot;A Gozar Con Mi Combo&quot;\nAlpha Banditos - &quot;The Bull is Wrong&quot;[2][3]\nTres Apenas como eso - &quot;Yo Te MirÃƒÂ©&quot;[2][4]\nEumir Deodato - &quot;Latin Flute&quot;\nMongo SantamarÃƒÂ­a - &quot;Mama Papa Tu&quot;\nMongo SantamarÃƒÂ­a - &quot;Me and You Baby (Picao y Tostao)&quot;\nMachito and his Afro-Cubans - &quot;Mambo Mucho Mambo&quot;\nUnaesta - &quot;La Vida es Una Lenteja&quot;[4]\nLonnie Liston Smith - &quot;Expansions&quot;\nIrakere - &quot;Anunga Nunga&quot;\nEumir Deodato - &quot;Super Strut&quot;\nXavier Cugat and his Orchestra - &quot;Jamay&quot;\nBenny MorÃƒÂ© - &quot;Maracaibo Oriental&quot;\nTito Puente - &quot;Mambo GozÃƒÂ³n&quot;\n\nFever 105\n\n\nFever 105 logo\nDJ: Oliver &quot;Ladykiller&quot;

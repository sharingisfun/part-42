The work of physicist, Nassim Haramein, provides insight into the structure of space-time and a new coherent model of the universe. Using the sacred geometry and codes in ancient monuments and documents, the film presents a new look at the reality of which we live !\n\nAs early as 9 years old, Nassim was already developing the basis for a unified hyperdimensional theory of matter and energy, which he eventually called the &quot;Holofractographic Universe.&quot;\n\nNassim has spent most of his life researching the fundamental geometry of hyperspace, studying a variety of fields from theoretical physics, cosmology, quantum mechanics, biology and chemistry to anthropology and ancient civilizations. Combining this knowledge with a keen observation of the behavior of nature, he discovered a specific geometric array that he found to be fundamental to creation, and the foundation for his Unified Field Theory emerged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea9eb44d2554ece8923e3d981e91ca1a400d229","amp;dn":"Black+Whole%2C+Scientific+Evidence+of+Oneness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea9eb44d2554ece8923e3d981e91ca1a400d229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,169,235,68,210,85,78,206,137,35,227,217,129,233,28,161,164,0,210,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The war that followed had global repercussions, destroying four empires and costing millions of lives. Even the victorious countries were scarred for a generation, and we still today remain within the conflict's shadow. In this major analysis David Stevenson re-examines the causes, course and impact of this 'war to end war', placing it in the context of its era and exposing its underlying dynamics. His book provides a wide-ranging international history, drawing on insights from the latest research. It offers compelling answers to the key questions about how this terrible struggle unfolded: questions that remain disturbingly relevant for our own time.\r\n\r\n'It's harder to imagine a better single-volume comprehensive history of the conflict than this superb study'  -- Ian Kershaw\r\n\r\n'Perhaps the best comprehensive one-volume history of the war yet written' New Yorker\r\n\r\n'David Stevenson is the real deal ... His defining characteristic is his outstanding rigour as an historian ... tremendously clever' -- Niall Ferguson\r\n\r\n'This history of the 1914-1918 conflict surpasses all others. It is tough, erudite and comprehensive' -- Independent\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nPaperback: 784 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin (25 Oct. 2012)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 071819795X\r\nISBN-13: 978-0718197957","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5f76631e1470973675dd56f345b76011ccc5c3","amp;dn":"1914-1918%3A+The+History+of+First+World+War+-+D.+Stevenson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5f76631e1470973675dd56f345b76011ccc5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,95,118,99,30,20,112,151,54,117,221,86,243,69,183,96,17,204,197,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

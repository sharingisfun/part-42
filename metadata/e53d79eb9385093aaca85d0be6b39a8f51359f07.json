There was the early bubble-glam period, where the Sweetshop shortened their name to Sweet and churned out Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman insta-hits like the insanely catchy &quot;Little Willy&quot; and the inane &quot;Wig Wam Bam.&quot; The band was soon tired of being pop pretty boys and really wanted to rock. Chinn/Chapman fed them &quot;Ballroom Blitz,&quot; but with &quot;Fox On The Run,&quot; Sweet proved they could make international hits fine on their own.\n\nAfter that, the band broke off with Chinn/Chapman and recorded &quot;Give Us A Wink,&quot; a sly glitter rock album that featured the incendiary &quot;Action.&quot; That was the roar that inspired 80's pop metal from Def Lepard to Poison, with &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot; and &quot;The Lies In Your Eyes,&quot; while not American Hits, are just as tasty.\n\nThen the band decided that hits alone weren't good enough, and they took a shot at musical &quot;credibility.&quot; &quot;Level Headed&quot; sounded less like Sweet and more like Alan Parsons, but &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot; (included here in the single edit) was a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the following album was without Brian Conolly and pretty much was a forgettable work. (&quot;Mother Earth&quot; was ok, &quot;Sixties Man,&quot; better.) But most of these songs are guilty pleasures, and still sound fresh now. After all, almost 30 years later, how can you resist that opening call of &quot;Ballroom Blitz?&quot;\n\n.....all right fellas, let's Goooooooooooooo!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Best of Sweet\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFLAC:\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3:\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

Meanwhile, memorabilia expert Lawrence values a guitar signed by Oasis, and an impressive diamond bracelet gives new branch manager Alicja a chance to secure an international client. Plus, a vivacious prospective customer hopes the proceeds from the sale of a set of designer handbags might help get a new business venture off the ground.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nMore customers arrive at Prestige Pawnbrokers, including a woman and her son, who are hoping to secure a loan against a 71-carat tanzanite ring they bought from a home-shopping channel. Prestige boss James Constantinou takes a shine to a bespoke show motorbike, and must fight against his instinct to claim the vehicle for himself as he seeks a buyer. Plus, a collection of 500 handbags arrives for valuation.\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nA teenage girl passes through the doors of Prestige Pawnbrokers, seeking to sell her grandfather's designer watch in an effort to fund her fledgling jewellery business. History expert Lawrence is delighted when he is presented with an autographed 1960s racing programme, and an online customer is shocked by the valuation received by her collection of luxury items. Plus, boss James Constantinou ends up crashing a converted double-decker bus when he takes it for a test drive.\r\n\r\n4)  Part 4 \r\nAn Ibiza club DJ plans to take her act beyond the shores of the party island, but needs funds to push herself into the global limelight, and hopes the sale of her designer goods will give her the money she needs to achieve her ambition. Enter handbag specialist Claudia, James Constantinou's fiancee, who offers the customer a big surprise. Meanwhile, Alicja gets excited when she claps eyes on a vintage gold and diamond timepiece, and Prestige boss James hopes to recoup his losses when an unredeemed Aston Martin goes to auction.\r\n\r\n5)  Part 5 \r\nAn international deal for James on a wine collection in Lanzarote may be worth a million Euros, and a couple look to sell their one-of-a-kind house boat. Elsewhere, a gastro pub owner wants to take a loan out against a Â£250,000 Bentley, and James considers a risky deal on an unusual giant gemstone.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Posh-Pawn-Series-4-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3172 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/cnn87w/posh-pawn/episodeguide/series-4\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Posh%20Pawn%3A%20At%20Christmas \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Posh%20Pawn%20Series%201","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:140908373eedbf6f2b8150c9b5626b53f8a8f698","amp;dn":"Ch4+Posh+Pawn+Series+4+5of5+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"140908373eedbf6f2b8150c9b5626b53f8a8f698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,9,8,55,62,237,191,111,43,129,80,201,181,98,107,83,248,168,246,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

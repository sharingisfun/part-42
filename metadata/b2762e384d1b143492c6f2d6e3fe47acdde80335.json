RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom\n           1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy\n\n\nMen of War: Vietnam is a new game for the critically acclaimed series. The\nnew, story-driven campaign lets you taste the explosive mix of the jungle,\nHueys and rock-n-roll in 1968. The US campaign focuses on a team of elite\nspecial ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit\nincludes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny\nArmstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill\nKirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the\nothers they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops. The\nNorth Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants\nand two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an\nambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North\nVietnam territory is a difficult one - they have no means of radio\ncommunication, no wheeled vehicles, and it's too far to make it there on\nfoot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath\nengagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet\noffensive. Missions range from special operations (rescuing a shot-down\npilot, escorting a reporter, etc.) to full scale battles.\nKey features:\n*  There are two sides in every story, so two new story-driven campaigns\n attempt to show the war from both sides.\n*  Breathtaking missions including an ambush on the Ho Chi Minh trail, a\n game of cat and mouse in the Mekong Delta, raids into Cambodia and Laos,\n bridge defense during the Tet offensive and more.\n*  New weapons and units: M-16, T-54, M-113, Patton III, M-60, AK-47, M-14,\n RPG-2, M-72 LAW, RPK and many more.\n*  Multiplayer mode - co-op for up to 4 players.\n\n\n2.

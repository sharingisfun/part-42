But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.\n\nplease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542152ec3a9790eecc32cf4e02b24b32acf9110f","amp;dn":"Gravity.2013%5BMobile%5D-Pockets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542152ec3a9790eecc32cf4e02b24b32acf9110f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,33,82,236,58,151,144,238,204,50,207,78,2,178,75,50,172,249,17,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

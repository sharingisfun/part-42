Brought to fame as producer, singer/songwriter and one of the founding members of rap rock band Hollywood Undead. He is also involved in a movement with fellow rapper The Truth (Vardan Aslanyan) called &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (often stylized as both &quot;9LIVES&quot; and &quot;IX LIVES&quot;). A common misconception is that Nine Lives is the name of Deuce's band. Deuce, however, describes Nine Lives as a &quot;gang&quot; of musicians and friends who get together to create, share and enjoy music the movement has since expanded from Los Angeles and has gained a large online-following\n\nNine Lives is the debut studio album by former Hollywood Undead frontman Deuce. \n\nDeuce commented on the album, saying, &quot;This album has that signature Deuce sound and is similar in flavor to what I [helped make] on Swan Songs, but completely unrestricted and rated NC-17. I took some of the shit I couldn't get away with on Swan Songs and brought it to another level for Nine Lives. If you liked what I did before, you will love this...&quot;\n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like Deuce, then please buy his music. Please, support the artists you like. This is years of blood, sweat and tears. Leave a comment &amp; rate this download &amp; please seed. This takes a lot of time &amp; effort. I cant do it all myself.\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66301f3081f3f3bdcfcd75d2eaa3a43f58a68548","amp;dn":"Deuce+-2012-+Nine+Lives+%28Complete+Bonus+Track+Edition%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66301f3081f3f3bdcfcd75d2eaa3a43f58a68548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,48,31,48,129,243,243,189,207,205,117,210,234,163,164,63,88,166,133,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

For those who prefer flac files, converting from ape is no problem: lossless to lossless = lossless. Most media players will do this, I use MediaMonkey. Standalone converters exist, also.I use xrecode. Any computer from the last 5 years can convert to the format of your choice in a matter of minutes (or less) for each CD.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07b982943dd086c2da0e8369e0654b09a37ca4ae","amp;dn":"Mercury+Living+Presence+Collection+%2841-51%29+%5Bape%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07b982943dd086c2da0e8369e0654b09a37ca4ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,185,130,148,61,208,134,194,218,14,131,105,224,101,75,9,163,124,164,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

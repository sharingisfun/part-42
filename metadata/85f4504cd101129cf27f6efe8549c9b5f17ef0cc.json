This was a big pain in the ass.  I had to *buy* this from Audible, *remove* the DRM with Goldwave, then *use* the Audible Manager to *identify* the track splits (Audible gives the shit to you in TEN 8 hour files) and use the MP3 splitter/joiner (which is one of the best, simplest, straightforward programs ever) to get the tracks properly split, named and joined (duh).  I know I'm just complaining, and no one cares, but I KNOW that it is NOT an ACCIDENT that no one ELSE has gone through all this trouble to make sure that the world will hear Bernard Mayes read father Plutarch's Lives in it's entirety.  Also, just a word for all of you homophobes:  Mr. Mayes is a complete, flaming, elderly homosexual.  So beware.  He is also guilty (notice how I associate &quot;homosexuality&quot; with &quot;guilty&quot;.  I am horrible.) of reading Blackstone Audiobooks unabridged recordings of Herodotus and Gibbon's Decline &amp; Fall (no kidding) as well.  Feel free to request a re-up, as I got them from Demonoid aeons ago.\n\nOtherwise, enjoy Plutarch read to you PROPERLY, but for fuck's sake, there's no way you can LISTEN to this work, you've got to READ it....but this way, you can LISTEN to it - before and after you've read it - while someone is paying you to do something else!

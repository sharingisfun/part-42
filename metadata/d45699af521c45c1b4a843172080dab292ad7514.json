At this point, the Fairfield Four's ever-changing lineup was comprised of Henry Brown, David Aaron, Willie Williams, and Joseph Henderson. At least, that's what the liner notes on the original LP say; according to the liner notes of the 2000 CD reissue on Ace, most of the leads are taken by Clarence Mills and the Reverend Sam McCrary. Bass singer Henderson, who also played guitar, was in fact the Joe Henderson who would have a Top Ten pop hit in 1962 with &quot;Snap Your Fingers.&quot; Regardless of who sang what, The Bells Are Tolling is a good gospel record with some trumpet-swallowing leads, particularly on &quot;Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around.&quot; Not many copies were pressed the first time around, and although it was reissued in 1973 as The Famous Fairfield Four With Rev. Samuel McCrary, it took the 2000 Ace CD reissue to make this album easy to find.~Richie Unterberger (Allmusic)\n\n''The Four are probably Nashville's best-known, most influential and certainly longest-performing African-American a cappella gospel quartet. 'Bells' is a rare album actually recorded 40 years ago at the Fairfield Missionary Baptist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, and it represents post-war gospel music at its best.''\n\n01.

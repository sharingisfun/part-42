He had an unusual ambition for a pop performer trying to make a name for himself - to appear on TV completely hidden by a prop. In his own words, to &quot;not appear, to stay behind something and not come out&quot;. He often hid behind the upturned collar of his leather jacket, or wrapped himself around, and effectively behind, the microphone lead.\n\nIt is said that Dave (real name David Grundy) changed his name because he was a fan of Chuck Berry. Whether this is actually true or not, Dave's first UK hit was with a cover of a Chuck Berry classic, Memphis Tennessee. My baby left me, another cover of an R+B classic, and Baby it's you, a cover of a Shirelles song that Dave may have learned from the Beatles, also made the UK charts.\nAfter three cover hits, Dave finally got an original song, The crying game, which he took into the UK top five. In his homeland, it is the song he is best remembered for. This position was reinforced via a movie of the same title, made in the nineties but featuring Dave's original recording as the title track.\n\nOne heart between two (another original song by the writer of The crying game) was only a minor hit. Dave then covered Little things (Bobby Goldsboro) and it became his second UK top five hit. Next came This strange effect, which was written by Ray Davies of the Kinks but not recorded by them. This was only a minor UK hit but topped the charts in Belgium and the Netherlands. His next two singles (I'm gonna take you there, If you wait for love) missed the UK charts but it is likely that they charted in Europe. Dave then returned to the UK top five with another cover, Mama (B J Thomas). This concluded Dave's run of chart success in the UK.\n\nThis compilation begin with his eight UK chart hits and ends with twelve of his best other tracks including the two singles that missed the UK charts. If you've heard and enjoyed any of Dave's songs (most likely The crying game) or if you like British pop music of the sixties generally, you should enjoy this collection. \n\n\n\n1 Memphis Tennessee   2:26 \n2 My Baby Left Me   2:03 \n3 Baby It's You   2:30 \n4 The Crying Game   2:45 \n5 One Heart Between Two   2:40 \n6 Little Things   2:26 \n7 This Strange Effect   2:31 \n8 Mama   2:53 \n9 Can I Get It From You   2:28 \n10 I'm Gonna Take You There   2:29 \n11 If You Wait for Love   3:09 \n12 Stranger   2:36 \n13 Heartbeat   2:12 \n14 Change Our Minds   3:09 \n15 Suspicions (In Your Mind)   2:46 \n16 I Got the Feeling   3:11 \n17 The Girl From the Fair Isle   2:06 \n18 Sticks and Stones   2:35 \n19 I Love You Baby   3:40 \n20 The Coffee Song   3:46 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4238ceecc4a0e3615dde471e6320ced959f4fcb","amp;dn":"Dave+Berry...The+Very+Best+of%281997%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4238ceecc4a0e3615dde471e6320ced959f4fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,35,140,238,204,74,14,54,21,221,228,113,230,50,12,237,149,159,79,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

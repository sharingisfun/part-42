I extracted the *ACTUAL* setup program from the wrapper executable, so this version should be (and is, to the best of my knowledge) CLEAN and VIRUS-FREE.\n\nMy computer became infected after running the original setup program, and it literally took 51 different virus/malware scanners and utilities to finally track the nasty little son-of-a-bitch down.  NONE of the major programs caught it.  The one tool that finally found and removed it was Hitman Pro 3.5, a program I HIGHLY recommend if you have a rootkit that evades detection by all other programs.\n\nThe original .exe *looks* like a setup program for PowerGREP 3, but it's not - it's a wrapper executable that contains the actual setup program as well as a number of virus files.  When executed, the virus installs rootkits in various places across the system, including the %TEMP% directory and the %WINDOWS%/System32/DRIVERS directory.\n\nThe rootkit then downloads additional virus files from malicious servers in France and Germany.  One of the many programs it installed was the infamous &quot;Internet Security 2010&quot; virus.  Joy.\n\nI set up a VMware Virtual Machine running Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 and installed a number of free virus/malware scanners to try and catch the rootkit.  I then ran the infected setup program to learn how it works.  Here are some screenshots:\n\nRootkit Installation: http://bayimg.com/kaJjLAaco\nLegitimate Installation: http://bayimg.com/lajjIAaCo\nExecutable Comparison: http://bayimg.com/LajjbAaCO\nBackground Process: http://bayimg.com/KAJJnAAcO\nWireshark Capture: http://bayimg.com/lAjJfaaCo\nHitman Pro Scan: http://bayimg.com/LAjJdaaCO\n\nThe good news is that the infected .exe extracts the *real* setup program to the %TEMP% directory, so I was able to copy it and run it independently to verify that it wasn't also infected.  I noticed that the extracted setup program contains a valid digital signature (security certificate), but the wrapper executable doesn't.\n\nAnyway, I hope someone finds this useful.  Please let me know in the comments if you have any questions about this bad boy.\n\n- drsquirlz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11905b87107cec9c838b7a8472e43275050fdb99","amp;dn":"JGSoft+PowerGREP+3.5.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11905b87107cec9c838b7a8472e43275050fdb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,144,91,135,16,124,236,156,131,139,122,132,114,228,50,117,5,15,219,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This version is encoded from the FLAC-files available here, using Lame 3.97 VBR, command-line settings -V2 --vbr-new, generally accepted as resulting in files hardly possible to differate from lossless for most people. The lame header is:\n\nQuality                       : 77\nVersion String                : Lame 3.97\nTag Revision                  : 0\nVBR Method                    : vbr-mtrh\nLowpass Filter                : 18600\nPsycho-acoustic Model         : nspsytune\nSafe Joint Stereo             : yes\nnogap (continued)             : no\nnogap (continuation)          : no\nATH Type                      : 4\nABR Bitrate                   : 32\nNoise Shaping                 : 1\nStereo Mode                   : Joint Stereo\nUnwise Settings Used          : no\nInput Frequency               : 44.1kHz\n\nFastline People is not as good as LP, but still enjoyable. It was not available here, but I found a good copy elsewhere. It is encoded with Lame 4.0alpha!!! (I think that anything but released versions should only be used for true testing and not be sread, but it is the best available version) with the following Lame header:\n\nQuality                       : 75\nVersion String                : Lame 4.0a\nTag Revision                  : 0\nVBR Method                    : vbr-new / vbr-mt\nLowpass Filter                : 19600\nPsycho-acoustic Model         : nspsytune\nSafe Joint Stereo             : no\nnogap (continued)             : no\nnogap (continuation)          : no\nATH Type                      : 0\nABR Bitrate                   : 193\nNoise Shaping                 : 1\nStereo Mode                   : Joint Stereo\nUnwise Settings Used          : no\nInput Frequency               : 44.1kHz\n\n\nEnjoy and leave a comment if you want to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c011ee5c5c74b0a423482dc2dff35130b141e68","amp;dn":"Antiloop+-+LP+%26+Fastline+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c011ee5c5c74b0a423482dc2dff35130b141e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,1,30,229,197,199,75,10,66,52,130,220,45,255,53,19,11,20,30,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

So he found an indoor stadium, brought in a special guest and worked up a 90-minute blast that debuts Sept. 8 on GAC, Blake Shelton Live: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s All About Tonight.\n\nBlake took over EvansvilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Roberts Stadium, the biggest facility heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s headlined to date, and filled most of the set list with hits, modeling his effort after an icon who grew up in the same homestate.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen I was a teenager in Oklahoma, Garth Brooks had his first television special and everybody I knew taped it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Blake says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was the biggest thing ever. I probably watched it 100 times; there was this huge stage and I remember thinking, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what you do, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what I want to do one day.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAppropriately, Blake Shelton Live is produced by Jon Small, who oversaw HBOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Emmy-nominated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGarth Live In Central ParkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 1997. That presentation included special guest appearances by Billy Joel and Don McLean. This one has an even more appropriate guest: BlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fiancee, Miranda Lambert, who joins him on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHome.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nElsewhere in the special, Blake turns in versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAustin,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSome Beach,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHillbilly BoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and his current No. 1 single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll About Tonight.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  In part of GACÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ30-Days of BlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ video series,  he shares some personal stories behind these hits, you can watch the clips online here.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talent, energy and great sense of humor combine to make a very entertaining special,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Sarah Trahern, GACÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Senior Vice President of Programming. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGAC is thrilled to be able to partner with him for his first televised special as we continue to deliver great country music performances to our audience.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBlake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976, in Ada, Oklahoma) is an American country music artist. In 2001, he made his debut with the single &quot;Austin&quot;. Released as the lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, &quot;Austin&quot; went on to spend five weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. This song was the first single from his gold-certified debut album, which also produced two more Top 20 hits. Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, Shelton was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.\n\nHis second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer (his first for Warner Bros. proper) and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn &amp; Grill, were each certified gold as well. Shelton's fourth album, Pure BS, was issued in 2007, and re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s pop hit &quot;Home&quot; as one of the bonus tracks. This cover was also that album's third single. A fifth album, Startin' Fires, was released in November 2008.\n\nOverall, Shelton has charted seventeen singles on the country charts, including seven Number One hits: &quot;Austin&quot; (2001), &quot;The Baby&quot; (2003), &quot;Some Beach&quot; (2004-2005), &quot;Home&quot; (2008), &quot;She Wouldn't Be Gone&quot; (2009), &quot;Hillbilly Bone&quot; (2010), a duet with Trace Adkins, and &quot;All About Tonight&quot; (2010). Additionally, three more of his singles have reached Top Ten: a cover version of Conway Twitty's &quot;Goodbye Time&quot;, &quot;Nobody but Me&quot;, and &quot;I'll Just Hold On.&quot;\n\n\nThis video is the complete show with commercials.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19738f4cae799eadd1bf79efa9322c740ce985b8","amp;dn":"Blake+Shelton+Live%3A+%5C%27It%5C%27s+All+About+Tonight+Show%5C%27+%28Xvid-2nafi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19738f4cae799eadd1bf79efa9322c740ce985b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,115,143,76,174,121,158,173,209,191,121,239,169,50,44,116,12,233,133,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

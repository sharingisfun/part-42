He and his wife now divide their time between Kingsmarkham and a coachhouse in Hampstead belonging to their actress daughter, Sheila. For all the benefits of a more relaxed way of life, Wexford misses being the law. But a chance meeting in a London street, with someone he had known briefly as a very young police constable, changes everything. Tom Ede is now a detective superintendent, and is very keen to recruit Wexford as an adviser on a difficult case. The bodies of two women and a man have been discovered in the old coal hole of an attractive house in St John's Wood. None carries identification. But the man's jacket pockets contain a string of pearls, a diamond and a sapphire necklace as well as other jewellery valued in the region of 40,000 pounds. Wexford is intrigued and excited by the challenge - until this new investigative role brings him into serious physical danger!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134ba66062c5a3d7df2b52f34287b7f2efadb7f3","amp;dn":"The+Vault+-+Ruth+Rendell+++%282011+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134ba66062c5a3d7df2b52f34287b7f2efadb7f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,75,166,96,98,197,163,215,223,43,82,243,66,135,183,242,239,173,183,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

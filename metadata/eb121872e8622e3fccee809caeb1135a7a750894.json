SMITH\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Analytical Separations is intended to be a multi-volume series, providing reviews of analytical separation methods and techniques used for the determination of analytes across a whole range of applications. Each volume will have a theme related to a particular area, for example, pharmaceuticals, health care, food production, the environment and biochemistry, and will provide guidance to the different methods that have been applied for particular analytes, their relative value to the user and their advantages and pitfalls. Each volume will also identify future trends, the potential impact of new technologies, and new separation methods in the specific field it is focussing on.This series of volumes will provide chemists and researchers in university, government and industrial laboratories with up-to-date surveys of the roles that analytical separations play now and in the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb121872e8622e3fccee809caeb1135a7a750894","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Analytical+Separations+Series+%5BVol+1-6%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb121872e8622e3fccee809caeb1135a7a750894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,18,24,114,232,98,46,63,204,238,128,156,174,177,19,90,122,117,8,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Titillating text messages. It's-not-you-it's-me relationship-enders. In Other PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Love Letters, Bill Shapiro has searched AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attics, closets, and cigar boxes and found actual lettersÃ¢â‚¬â€œunflinchingly honest missives full of lust, provocation, guilt, and vulnerabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€œwritten only for a loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. Modern love, of course, is not all bliss, and in these pages youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find the full range of a relationship, with its whispered promises as well as its heartache. But what at first appears to be a deliciously voyeuristic peek into other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most passionate moments, will ultimately reawaken your own desires and tendernessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦because when you read these letters, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find the heart youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking into is actually your own.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;i think UR great. wanna have wine &amp; Tequila again sometime?&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;I can't believe you're real, and I think about you constantly in some way or the other all day. I haven't given the finger to anyone driving since I met you.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;With you I learned how to fight cleaner, how to talk things out better, and how to make a strong loving family out of nothing. These are priceless gifts that I will carry with me the rest of my life. One more thing you did for me: you left, and I had to get through it.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;P.S. I look forward to your letters too much to call. Also, where do you stand on chains?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c5fd7917ba021391d175a838df1fae504ef705b","amp;dn":"Other+People%27s+Love+Letters+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c5fd7917ba021391d175a838df1fae504ef705b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,95,215,145,123,160,33,57,29,23,90,131,141,241,250,229,4,239,112,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

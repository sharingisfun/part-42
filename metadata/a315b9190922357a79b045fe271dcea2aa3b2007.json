His wife Eva (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Braun), committed suicide with him by ingesting cyanide. That afternoon, in accordance with Hitlers prior instructions, their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunkers emergency exit, doused in petrol and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker. The Soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed, cremated and the ashes scattered.\n\nThere have been different accounts citing the cause of his death; one that he died by poison only and another that he died by a self-inflicted gunshot, while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. There was also an eye-witness account that recorded the body showing signs of having been shot through the mouth but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments which were recovered. Further, the exact location of where Hitlers ashes were scattered also differs, depending on the historical source consulted.\n\nDramatizations\n\nThe Death of Adolf Hitler is a British 1973 made-for-television production. Set in the FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrerbunker, it follows the last ten days of HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life. It stars Frank Finlay in the title role, who won a BAFTA award of Best Actor for his performance.\n\nHitler: The Last Ten Days is a 1973 feature film directed by Ennio De Concini and starring Sir Alec Guinness in the title role.\n\nThe Bunker was a 1981 made-for-television film directed by George Schaefer and based on the book The Bunker (1978) by James ODonnell about the last months of the war and days in the FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrerbunker from 17 January 1945 to 2 May 1945. Sir Anthony Hopkins won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Hitler.\n\nWar and Remembrance is a 1989 American TV miniseries. Part 12 (its final part) devotes several minutes to a realistic portrayal of Hitlers final few days except that General Weidling is replaced by a fictitious character (&quot;General Armin von Roon&quot;).\n\nDer Untergang (Downfall) is a 2004 German feature film largely set in and around the FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrerbunker. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel reconstructed the look and atmosphere through eyewitness accounts, various survivor memoirs and other verified sources. It also carries an interview with Traudl Junge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a315b9190922357a79b045fe271dcea2aa3b2007","amp;dn":"The+Death+of+Adolf+Hitler+-+1973+-+BAFTA+Winner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a315b9190922357a79b045fe271dcea2aa3b2007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,21,185,25,9,34,53,122,121,176,69,254,39,29,206,162,170,59,32,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

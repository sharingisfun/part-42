The great tragedies shed light on the extraordinary time, place, and people that produced them.\n\nAnd they may help usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as perhaps they helped their original audiencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to grasp a fuller sense of both the terror and wonder that life presents. \n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n24 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n   1.

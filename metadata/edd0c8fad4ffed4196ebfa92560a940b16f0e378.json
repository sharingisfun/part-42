It's a strategy / management / simulation game that does away with all the base building and delays and gets straight to the meat and potatoes of science-fiction games: The big space battles fought by huge spaceships with tons of laser beams and things going 'zap!', 'ka-boom!' and 'ka-pow!'.\n\nIn GSB you put your ships together from modular components, arrange them into fleets, give your ships orders of engagement and then hope they emerge victorious from battle (or at least blow to bits in aesthetically pleasing ways).\n\nGratuitous Space Battles aims to bring the over-the-top explodiness back into space strategy games. The game is for everyone who has watched big space armadas battle it out on TV and thought to themselves 'I could have done a much better job as admiral'. \n\nThis is not a game of real-time arcade twitch reflexes. GSB is about what ships you design, and what you tell them to do. Your individual ship commanders have total autonomy during the chaotic battle that unfolds. This is not a tactical game, it is a strategic one. These gratuitous space battles are not won by plucky heroes with perfect teeth, but by the geeky starship builders who know exactly what ratio of plasma-cannons to engines each ship in the fleet will need.\n\nIf fighting against a fixed fleet of enemy ships isn't your thing, then GSB also has two 'survival mode' maps. In these battles, your fleet is helplessly outnumbered by wave after wave of enemies that warp in and attack you. Your fleet's final defeat is certain, but how many enemy ships will you blast to atoms before you go down with your ship? \n\nYour space fleet awaits!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd0c8fad4ffed4196ebfa92560a940b16f0e378","amp;dn":"Gratuitous+Space+Battles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd0c8fad4ffed4196ebfa92560a940b16f0e378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,208,200,250,212,255,237,65,150,235,250,146,86,10,148,11,22,240,227,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

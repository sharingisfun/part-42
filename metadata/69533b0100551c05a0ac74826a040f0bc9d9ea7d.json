Through his music he wanted to commemorate the past kytherian generations, his ancestors who lived, struggled and buried under this very land.\n\nThe work SINAXIS is a compilation of music and songs, specially written for traditional instruments (renaissance lutes, tremble viols and recorders) and the extraordinary chorus voices of Lyrae Cantus. It is the result of the collaboration between Kytherian composer Catelouso (Panayotis Leftheris) and the medieval music ensemble Lyrae Cantus.\n\nThe music and songs on this project were inspired by the inexorable flux of time, whether it be its imprint on the ruins of a village built on rock, or on the yellowing photographs of past generations, or in the nostalgic verses of the island?s poets.  Elements of traditional and medieval music are combined with contemporary harmonic idioms, and the pieces are sung and performed on old instruments by Lyrae Cantus. One of the unique characteristics of ?SINAXIS? is its remarkably broad appeal. It will delight enthusiasts of medieval renaissance music as much as it will those whose who take pleasure in Greek traditional music or more generally in World- ethnic music.\n\n[b]Tracklist[/b]\n1 EKKLISIASTIS kef.th&amp;#039;, 5\n2 EK NIHTOS ORTHRIZI\n3 KE THE NA LEME\n4 HOROS A\n5 I SINAXI\n6 TO PIGADI\n7 NIFIATIKO\n8 AGONIA\n9 IDERLOUDIO\n10 EKKLISIASTIS kef.th&amp;#039;, 7\n11 HOKETOUS\n12 TA KOULOUTHRA\n13 HOROS V\n14 LAGGADIANO NERO\n15 TO TRAGOUDI TOU TENOROU\n16 OMORFI POU &amp;#039;SE\n17 EKKLISIASTIS kef.g&amp;#039;, 1\n18 I TAFI\n19 PASHALINO GRAMMA\n20 OMORFI POU &amp;#039;SE (bonus track)\n\n[b]Related links:[/b]\nh**p://www.kytheriosmusic.com/\n\n[b]Technical characteristics:[/b]\nEncoder:  LAME v3.97\nBitrate:  320 kbps (CBR)\nStereo Mode:  Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69533b0100551c05a0ac74826a040f0bc9d9ea7d","amp;dn":"Catelouso-Lyrae+Cantus+-+Sinaxis+%5Bgreek+acoustic%2Fclassical%2Ffolk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69533b0100551c05a0ac74826a040f0bc9d9ea7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,83,59,1,0,85,28,5,160,172,116,130,106,4,15,11,201,217,234,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Appropriately this book has been called &quot;the book between.&quot; As far as the structure of the scriptures is concerned it fits perfectly between the four records of our Lord's earthly ministry and the epistles of Paul.\n\nActs is the most fascinating story book of the Bible, and at the same time the most important key to the understanding of God's dealings with man today. It is impossible to rightly divide the Word of truth without an understanding of the Book of Acts, and the confusion in the Church today is matched exactly by her confusion over this book. Acts is most thrilling to study, when &quot;dispensationally considered.&quot; Think of the dramatic narratives in this great book all progressively unfolding the divine program so that we may understand God's present dealings with us! (On Dr. Ruckman's recommended reading list.)\n\n\nAbout the author:\nPastor Stam's first pastorate was in Preakness, New Jersey, and it was there that The Berean Searchlight magazine began as an outgrowth of a small church bulletin containing a brief weekly Bible lesson by Pastor Stam. With the help of the church, it grew into a monthly Bible-study magazine. Then in 1945, Pastor Stam and his first wife Henrietta (who called him &quot;Neil,&quot; by the way) moved to Milwauke, Wisconsin, to join Charles F. Baker in founding Milwaukee Bible Institute. After five years at MBI, Pastor Stam resigned in order to devote himself full-time to the Searchlight. In 1952, the Berean Bible Society, &quot;An organization for the Promotion of Bible Study,&quot; was formed with a board of directors and Pastor Stam as founding president. A year later BBS moved to Chicago on West Belmont Avenue.\n\nDuring Pastor Stam's 70-year ministry, he wrote more than 30 books and many more booklets. His most popular book throughout all those years and even to date has been Things That Differ, a general introduction to dispensationalism as well as to the distinctive variety represented by the Grace Movement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94d1b8eb730f9b64b605c436d97c00abb27dddf8","amp;dn":"Acts+Dispensationally+Considered+-+Cornelius+R.+Stam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94d1b8eb730f9b64b605c436d97c00abb27dddf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,209,184,235,115,15,155,100,182,5,196,54,217,124,0,171,178,125,221,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

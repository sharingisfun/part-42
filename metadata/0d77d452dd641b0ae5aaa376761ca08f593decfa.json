I also offer travel tips and advice that\nonly a local would know. But after Hurricane Katrina devastated New\nOrleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast in 2005, this revision has proven\nmore difficult Ã¢â‚¬â€ both logistically and emotionally Ã¢â‚¬â€ to write than I\nexpected. For although many of the neighborhoods, places and historic\nlandmarks you will want to visit have been mercifully spared, much\nmore of the city (that perhaps visitors would not typically tour) was not.\nWhen Hurricane Katrina first threatened the Crescent City, my husband\nand I chose to evacuate our Lakeview home with our many beloved pets.\nIt was a wise decision, as our home and neighborhood were devastated\nby flooding from the breached levees. For days, even weeks after\nKatrina, we spent hours on the phone trying to find out if our friends\nand neighbors were safe. Some had stayed and some had evacuated like\nus. Thankfully, everyone we knew was okay, but we knew that many\nothers lost loved ones or couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find someone dear to them.\nDuring those first weeks after the storm, the city itself seemed lost. When\nI first saw video footage of the flooding, I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize my own neighborhood.\nI feared the worst. But as time passed, and people began to\nrecover and rebuild, it became clear that the city would survive. Old traditions\nand places that were once taken for granted are now revered and\nhonored. Communities that had fallen by the wayside due to poverty\nand inadequate education are finding support from around the world.\nAnd everyone is coming together to help one another like never before.\nSo when you visit New Orleans, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if you get caught up\nin the spirit of the locals. Once easy and carefree, they are now fiercely\ndetermined to make Ã¢â‚¬Å“The City That Care ForgotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ one that you will\nalways remember. I hope that you find this book to be both practical and\ninspirational as you discover New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many pleasures.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d77d452dd641b0ae5aaa376761ca08f593decfa","amp;dn":"New.Orleans.for.Dummies.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d77d452dd641b0ae5aaa376761ca08f593decfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,119,212,82,221,100,27,10,229,170,163,118,118,28,160,143,89,61,236,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

They signed to Virgin and three albums followed, Below the Belt (1975), Absolutely (1977) and Bloodletting (1979), which also featured Bobby Tench and Boz Burrell. The band dissolved after Absolutely when Patto became ill.\n\nThe band was managed by Nigel Thomas who secured a five album deal over five years with CBS, reputed to have been worth Ã‚Â£1.2 million and was never fully executed due to Patto's death on 4 March 1979. During a six-year period Boxer also toured the US and Europe.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow the Belt was the debut album by Boxer, released on the Virgin label in January 1976. The album attracted less attention for its music than for its cover art. Photographed by Alex Henderson with graphics by Richard Evans, the cover featured model Stephanie Marrian spreadeagled and naked but for a pair of shoes, with a man's arm reaching up between her legs and his boxing-gloved hand hiding her genitalia. The back cover at first showed Stephanie in complete full-frontal nudity, but later pressings covered her up with the band's belt-styled logo. The cover was completely re-designed for the US market using the band photo from the inside of the UK gatefold cover. The lineup of this album is based around a live show quartet with keyboardist Chris Stainton brought in during the recording sessions.\n\n\n\n\nKeith Ellis - Bass\nOllie Halsall - Guitar and Keyboards\nTony Newman - Drums\nMike Patto - Keyboards and Vocals\nChris Stainton - Keyboards\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62df7a5fce2e90d556816f2056ac0b8d589d1e8c","amp;dn":"Boxer+-+Below+The+Belt+%5B1975%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62df7a5fce2e90d556816f2056ac0b8d589d1e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,223,122,95,206,46,144,213,86,129,111,32,86,172,11,141,88,157,30,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

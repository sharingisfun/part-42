But happy endings are not so easy to come by and the two of them quickly discover that London is not as cool as they thought. Their London apartment is anything but a mansion and WimpieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s English teammates give him a hard time. WimpieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier nemesis, Werner, is also in WimpieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team and together they start a proudly South African rugby team. The players they manage to round up are not really winning material and they have little hope of winning the league. By some miracle, the unlikely team manages to achieve some success and as they draw closer to the final match, it seems as if Wimpie and KatrienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy ending will depend on the success of the team.

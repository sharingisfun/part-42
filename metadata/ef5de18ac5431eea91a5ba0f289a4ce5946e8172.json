The term marks an ironic way of setting the differences with tropical music and also makes nods to other genres such as cumbia villera, the urban sound born and bred in the marginal neighborhoods of Argentina and Uruguay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5de18ac5431eea91a5ba0f289a4ce5946e8172","amp;dn":"Campo+-+Campo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5de18ac5431eea91a5ba0f289a4ce5946e8172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,93,225,138,197,67,30,234,145,165,186,15,40,154,76,229,148,110,129,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

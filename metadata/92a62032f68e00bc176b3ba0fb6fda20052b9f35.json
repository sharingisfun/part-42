THERE IS NO AUDIO, SO PUT YOUR FAVORITE TUNES ON. THERE IS NO SPEAKING IN THIS VIDEO ANYWAY.\n\nAn all new technical trials riding film starring Ryan Leech, Thomas Ohler, and Dylan Korba.\n\nCRUX defined: a particular point of difficulty. This singular word precisely describes the riding formula of the film. Each and every line that the featured athletes, Ryan Leech, Thomas Ohler, and Dylan Korba ride has a CRUX. These three riders, aggresively persuing Leech\\&amp;#039;s Manifesto Style, execute mind-bending feats of bike mastery. Combining shear difficulty with an elegant and creative style. This film is presented by RL Action and Alias Lab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a62032f68e00bc176b3ba0fb6fda20052b9f35","amp;dn":"CRUX+DVD+%28MTB+TRIALS+-RYAN+LEECH%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a62032f68e00bc176b3ba0fb6fda20052b9f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,166,32,50,246,142,0,188,23,107,59,160,251,111,218,32,5,43,159,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

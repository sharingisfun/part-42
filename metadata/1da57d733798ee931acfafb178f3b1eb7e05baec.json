Simon Ramsay, a successful and seemingly respectable businessman, receives an email with a photograph attached. If he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come up with Ã‚Â£50k, the sender will release it to the press, and RamsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career will be over. In a state of panic he contacts his mistress, Laura. He tells her a blackmailer has managed to get his hands on a compromising photo of them in bed together. Terrified of what her violent husband will do if he finds out about her affair, Laura enlists the services of McAteer to deal with the blackmailer. It is a moment of madness, with disastrous consequences. And it falls to DCI Anderson and his sidekick to unravel the trail of death and destruction.\n\n\n\nAuthors:\tBill Daly\nFormats:\tEPUB, MOBI, PDF, AZW3\nTags:         Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense, Crime Fiction\nPublisher: Old Street Publishing (April 1, 2014)\nPrint Length: 302 pages \nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00ILZPWLI\nISBN-10: 190869954X\nISBN-13: 978-1908699541\n\n\n\nNote:  If you are having the &quot;404 Torache Error&quot; then please use the magnet link to download.

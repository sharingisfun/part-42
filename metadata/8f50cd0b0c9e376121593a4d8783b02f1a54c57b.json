We believe on the ground idealism of the root\nof the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and\nnothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do\nthis for the competition and the heart of what got the scene\nstarted in the mid eighties\n\nIf you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back\non contacting us as soon as possible\n\n_______ __ ___ _____ /\\__\n\\ / |/ /_/\\_| \\ \\ _ \\ / /_ \\/\\ /\\\n/\\ \\/| / / \\/\\/| |\\ \\ \\//_// / / / / / /\n/ \\ \\| \\ \\ / \\| |_\\ \\ / / \\/ /_/ / /// /\n\\____/|_|\\_\\\\__/|___/ / /_/\\_/\\__/_/\\____/\ntwice the fun \\/ double the trouble\n\nSpecial Note:\n\nDear RELOADED\n\nWe like how you turned your own &quot;serious&quot; discussion into a\nquestionalble discussion\n\nYou did take the chance to proper our latest SecuROM releases\nbut you were a bit too fast on doing so. Simply because your\nown cheesy methods of dealing with SecuROM. Yes, you reverse\nthe protection, unless the game feature VM triggers. Those you\nchoose to emulate the exact same way as we did those SecuROM\nreleases we released this month\n\nYou call us stealers of this SecuROM method, but we haven't\nstolen anything. So stop doing that! The funny thing is that\nwe have looked at your Steam emulator code that exactly match\nthe public available source code onStealing have\nanother meaning now, doesn't it?\n\nYou had the same fight with other groups in the past, when\nsomeone propered your SecuROM method, but in the end, these\nsame groups found out that they had to emulate those VM calls\nthemselves or else they were unable to win future SecuROM\nreleases from you\n\nWe choose to call it evolution of time, as you yourseles have\nbeen focusing on speed rather than proper reversing. The\nproblem is that the scene started to race with the P2P/WEB\npersons/groups as the public don't care about if a game is\nproperly reversed or not. They just want to play games that\nworks without any triggers tampering with the enjoyment of the\ngames. Sadly you have taken a huge step in that direction with\nyour activation of Tages, Solidshield, Solidshield 2, Themida\nand of course SecuROM VM calls\n\nReleases like these examples(real list is quite long):\n\nNaild-RELOADED\n\nSoldshield 2 - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nNeed.for.Speed.Hot.Pursuit-RELOADED\n\nSoldshield 2 - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nFifa.Manager.11-RELOADED\n\nSoldshield 2 - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nTwo.Worlds.II-RELOADED\n\nActivation - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nBlazblue.Calamity.Trigger-RELOADED\n\nTheMedia - Game not cracked(prot on game exe intact), loader\n\nRisen-RELOADED\n\nSolidshield - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nThe.Chronicles.of.Riddick.Assault.on.Dark.Athena-RELOADED\n\nSolidshield - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nJames.Camerons.Avatar.The.Game-RELOADED\n\nSolidshield - Game not cracked(untouched), just activated\n\nWe could continue, but what's the point? You know, you write\nabout holes that should been kept in the dark, so the\nprotection developers wont close them. Pretty silly remark as\nyou already mentioned that P2P/WEB people already have found\nthese holes themselves. You actually seem to know much more\nabout the P2P/WEB than the scene you're releasing in\n\nWe're not living in year 2000 anymore, a period with &quot;heavy&quot;\nprotections mostly known as CD checks. It's soon 2011 and\nyour method thinking in your nfo is still in the past, but\nwhy spend hours and hours reversing something, when the end\nresult is aworking game release anyway? Well you\nalready answered that question with the bunch of releases we\nmentioned above. Quality takes time, then why do you yourself\nuse cheap ass methods?\n\nWe will promise to stop the releases of future SecuROM titles\ndone this way, if you promise to stop your own activation\nmethod. It's in the same league\n\nGo &quot;group request&quot; nuke those activation releases of yours and\nwe will do the same with our SecuROM cracks. It's just that\nsimple\n\nOn with the game release information:\n\nThe Oddboxx is bundle of all of Oddworld Inhabitants\ncritically-acclaimed, award-winning classics, Abe's Oddysee\nAbe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath both\navailable for the first time to PC owners\n\nSpanning thirteen years of one-of-a-kind gaming experiences\nthis package aims to give fans old and new an affordable and\nconvenient way to enjoy these games once again, with a few new\nadditions and enhancements\n\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Unpack release\n2. Mount image or burn it\n3. Install\n4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD\nto the main installation folder and overwrite\n5. Play the game\n\nThe Skid Row family wish you and your family a merry christmas\nand a happy new year. See you in 2011!\n\nSupport the companies, which software you actually enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f50cd0b0c9e376121593a4d8783b02f1a54c57b","amp;dn":"Oddworld+The+Oddboxx-SKIDROW-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f50cd0b0c9e376121593a4d8783b02f1a54c57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,80,205,11,12,158,55,97,33,89,58,77,135,131,176,47,26,84,197,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

You'll be guided through the entire process of creating a gorgeous, usable web site by applying the timeless principles of user-centered design.\n\nEven if you're short on design skills, with this book you'll be creating your own stunning web sites in no time at all.\n\nThroughout, the focus is on simple and practical techniques that anyone can use - you don't need to have gone to art school or have artistic flair to create stunning designs using the methods outlined in this book.\n\nThe book's full-color layout and large format (8&quot; x 10&quot;) make Sexy Web Design a pleasure to read.\n\n    * Master key web interface design principles\n    * Design amazing web interfaces from scratch\n    * Create beautiful, yet functional, web sites\n    * Unleash your artistic talents\n    * And much more\n\nWho should read this book?\n\nWhether you're completely new to web design, a seasoned pro looking for inspiration, or a developer wanting to improve your sites' aesthetics, there's something for everyone here.\n\nHow? Because instead of trying to cover every possible area of creating a web site, we've focused purely on the design stage; that is, everything that happens before a single line of code is written.\n\nHowever, great design is more than just aesthetics. Long before we open our graphics program of choice, we'll be conducting research, dealing with clients, responding to briefs, sketching out sitemaps, planning information architecture, moving from doodles to diagrams, exploring different ways of interactivity, and building upon design traditions.\n\nBut ultimately, you'll be finding out how to create web sites that look drop-dead gorgeous.\n\n\n# Paperback: 172 pages\n# Publisher: SitePoint; 1 edition (April 4, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0980455235\n# ISBN-13: 978-0980455236","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b93368ae034c2cfc926322802a44bcea0fed71","amp;dn":"Sexy+Web+Design%3A+Creating+Interfaces+That+Work+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b93368ae034c2cfc926322802a44bcea0fed71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,185,51,104,174,3,76,44,252,146,99,34,128,42,68,188,234,15,237,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

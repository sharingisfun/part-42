Rotman\n\n\nLearning Modern Algebra aligns with the CBMS Mathematical Education of Teachers II recommendations, in both content and practice. It emphasizes rings and fields over groups, and it makes explicit connections between the ideas of abstract algebra and the mathematics used by high school teachers.\n\nIt provides opportunities for prospective and practicing teachers to experience mathematics for themselves, before the formalities are developed, and it is explicit about the mathematical habits of mind that lie beneath the definitions and theorems.\n\nGenre: Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20eb48795ad7cd03fd90652b8ae6c4e5247b9a1b","amp;dn":"Learning+Modern+Algebra+by+Al+Cuoco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20eb48795ad7cd03fd90652b8ae6c4e5247b9a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,235,72,121,90,215,205,3,253,144,101,43,138,230,196,229,36,123,154,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

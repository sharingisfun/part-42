All done with an acoustic guitar, without the testosterone, the distorted guitars, the banshee vocals. Sung softly late at night because of a landlord with a temper. A great song can be just as powerful with just one voice and one guitar. Other than that I wanted bring forward the words and the melody. \n\nCampfire Songs Vol.2 will be a little different with drums, bass, piano and what not. But the concept remain the same. Some work in progress demos are in the Misc-folder. Let me know if there's any problems with the torrent. Please seed after you've done, it's hard for me to spread the music without the back up from a huge fan base and a record company.\nLeave a comment if you please. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://deltidsharmonisk.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://deltidsharmonisk.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nCD1\n\n1.

The ultimate goal for designing a predisposal waste-management system depends on producing waste containers suitable for storage, transportation and permanent disposal. Cement-Based Materials for Nuclear-Waste Storage provides a roadmap for the use of cementation as an applied technique for the treatment of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes. Coverage includes, but is not limited to, a comparison of cementation with other solidification techniques, advantages of calcium-silicate cements over other materials and a discussion of the long-term suitability and safety of waste packages as well as cement barriers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:200e1bf1d3ce3d29129becbc6cdfca0bd23fc8f5","amp;dn":"Cement-Based+Materials+for+Nuclear+Waste+Storage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"200e1bf1d3ce3d29129becbc6cdfca0bd23fc8f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,14,27,241,211,206,61,41,18,155,236,188,108,223,202,11,210,63,200,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

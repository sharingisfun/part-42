The Eagles also cover a Tom Waits tune, &quot;Ol' 55,&quot; and pay tribute to alt-country godfather Gram Parsons on &quot;My Man.&quot; The album title is prophetic in the sense that the band that made this record (bolstered by the addition of guitarist Don Felder) was on the verge of greatness, but not\nquite there yet. --Daniel Durchholz\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Already gone                                         [04:16]\n02.You never cry like A lover                           [04:01]\n03.Midnight flyer                                       [03:58]\n04.My man                                               [03:31]\n05.On the border                                        [04:25]\n06.James dean                                           [03:38]\n07.Ol' 55                                               [04:22]\n08.Is it true                                           [03:15]\n09.Good day in hell                                     [04:27]\n10.The best of my love                                  [04:34]\n____\n\n40:27 min\n 61,1 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7500ad7473c2936ae8c41b5c1b872067d2b6bf","amp;dn":"The_Eagles-On_The_Border-%28Retail%29-1974-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7500ad7473c2936ae8c41b5c1b872067d2b6bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,117,0,173,116,115,194,147,106,232,196,27,92,27,135,32,103,210,182,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

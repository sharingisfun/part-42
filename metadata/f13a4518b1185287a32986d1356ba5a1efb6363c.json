The vaunted duo are best known for their recent collaboration with Bliss N Eso on their #1, Platinum-selling album 'Running On Air', but have been making waves in the Hip Hop scene since 2006, with the release of their first mixtape 'For Our Hip Hoppers', their 2008 album 'Keepin' It Breezy' and 2009's 'Free The Wolves' mixtape. This was supported by a swag of big name supports, including the likes of Bliss N Eso, Muph &amp; Plutonic, Pegz, Drapht, Downsyde, Pez, 360, DJ Flagrant and Def Wish Cast, as well as international heavyweights Method Man, Redman, Masta Ace and Mystro. Continuing their meteoric rise, in 2010 Mind Over Matter were invited to collaborate on Bliss N Eso's aforementioned 'Running On Air', contributing verses to the track &quot;Where The Wild Things Are&quot;. To support the release, Mind Over Matter were invited on tour by Bliss N Eso, as the main support on their sold out national &quot;Down By The River&quot; tour. 2011 now marks the release of Mind Over Matter's sophomore album 'Just Like Fireworks', from which the first single &quot;Rappers In Wonderland&quot; has already been added to the Triple J and FBi playlists. The 17 tracker is host to a melody of original and sample-based beats which features a list of talented guest vocalists including Pigeon John, Vida Sunshyne, Saving Grace, Drakezilla, Jon Reichardt, Ernst Carter Junior (aka Sam Mcniell) and Lillian Blue. It also features beats from the likes of Matik (Pez/Seth Sentry), Poker Beats (Hilltop Hoods), Konfuzion, Allrounda, DJ Ilz, Jon Reichardt and Saving Grace.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc 1:\n1.Capture The Spark\n2.Rappers In Wonderland\n3.Just Like Fireworks\n4.Harder Feat.

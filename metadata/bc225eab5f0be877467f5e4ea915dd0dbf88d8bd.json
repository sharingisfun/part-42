It was the Protestant ethic whose characteristicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“thrift, a respect for enquiry, individualism tempered by a need to cooperate, success as a measure of divine approvalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“helped to create the conditions which led to AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s managerial and corporate success. Thus, the authors contend, the drive, energy and acceptance of innovation, competition, growth and social mobility, all have their origins in the discipline and ethos of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first wave of European immigrants: the Puritans. And, the authors warn, as Americans distance themselves from core values which produced their nineteenth and twentieth century business and economic successes, they endanger the basis for their prosperity and security.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc225eab5f0be877467f5e4ea915dd0dbf88d8bd","amp;dn":"The+Puritan+Gift+Reclaiming+the+American+Dream+Amidst+Global+Fin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc225eab5f0be877467f5e4ea915dd0dbf88d8bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,34,94,171,95,11,232,119,70,127,94,78,169,21,221,13,191,136,216,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

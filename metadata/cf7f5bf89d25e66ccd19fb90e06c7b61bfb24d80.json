This duet between trumpeter Sei Miguel and Pedro Gomes on guitar is\nsomething unique. Both are minimalists, but while Miguel using his trumpet\nmainly in a traditional and voiced mode, Gomes extracts sweet acoustic sounds\nor extremely harsh electric sounds from his guitar.\n\nYet it is far from noise : the volume of the guitar is low, the distortion\nmaximal, the notes minimal. Both musicians play plaintive, sad phrases, full of\nlonging and crying and pain and restrained anger, quietly, almost resigned yet\nextremely expressive. The album is so powerful that the listening experience is\nof an immediacy that is uncommon. The feelings they have seem to be transmitted\ndirectly to the listener, without the distance of appreciation or\ninterpretation or any other form of rationalisation.\n\nYou feel the sounds, the sounds are what you feel in a real phyisical sense :\nsetting your nerves on edge, sending shivers down your spine, giving you\ngoosebumps, making you want to flee or cry. The few, more bluesy, pieces with\nacoustic guitar come as a relief, a welcome pause for the nervous system\n... only to be dragged back into a universe of extreme tension : an uneasy\nbeauty, harsh warmth, raw embraces, hard truths ... as if every release of\ntension creates its own new tension again ... And it requires incredible skill\nto maintain this for the entire album, without straying, without relinquishing\nthe concept.\n\nThis is music without compromise, yet its vision is clear, its voice is unique,\na listening experience that is not always pleasant, but extremely rewarding.\n\nGreat art.\n\n--\n\nBy John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/turbina-anthem-sei-miguel-pedro-gomes-nobusiness-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/turbina-anthem-sei-miguel-pedro-gomes-nobusiness-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nPar HÃƒÂ©ctor Cabrero (fr)\n\nPor Regina Morais (pt) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pontoalternativo.com/album/sei-miguel-e-pedro-gomes/turbina-anthem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pontoalternativo.com/album/sei-miguel-e-pedro-gomes/turbina-anthem&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7f5bf89d25e66ccd19fb90e06c7b61bfb24d80","amp;dn":"Sei+Miguel%2C+Pedro+Gomes+-+Turbina+Anthem+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7f5bf89d25e66ccd19fb90e06c7b61bfb24d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,127,91,248,157,37,230,108,205,25,251,144,224,108,123,97,191,178,77,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

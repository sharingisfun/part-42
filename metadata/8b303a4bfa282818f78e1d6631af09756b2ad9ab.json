Michelli offers a perspective on the leadership principles that drove the iconic coffee companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resurgence from serious setbacks during the economic downturn--one of the few true turnaround stories of this time. And the company continues to grow dramatically, entering new markets and channels with fresh products and technologies.\n\nIn Leading the Starbucks Way, Michelli establishes five actionable principles that fuel long-term global sustainability at Starbucks and that can be used in any company, in any industry:\n\n1. Savor and Elevate\n2. Love to Be Loved\n3. Reach for Common Ground\n4. Mobilize the Connection\n5. Cherish and Challenge Your Legacy\n\nLeading the Starbucks Way is a penetrating look at the inner workings of one of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful brands. The company gave Michelli one-on-one access to a variety of employees (called partners) to write this book--from baristas to senior leaders, including Howard Schultz, chairman, president, and chief executive officer.\n\nIn short, success is all about loving your product, loving your customers, and loving your employees. Sincerely. Without fail. Even in the face of business challenges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b303a4bfa282818f78e1d6631af09756b2ad9ab","amp;dn":"Leading+the+Starbucks+Way+-+Joseph+Michelli.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b303a4bfa282818f78e1d6631af09756b2ad9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,48,58,75,250,40,40,24,247,142,29,102,49,175,9,117,107,42,217,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When Britain entered the war, two-thirds of all Britain's food was imported - and now it was under threat from a Nazi blockade. To save Britain from starvation, the nation's farmers were tasked with doubling food production in what Churchill called 'the frontline of freedom'. This meant ploughing up 6.5 million acres of unused land - a combined area bigger than the whole of Wales.\nDue to audio problems with the last upload of this release , i have re-done it from the DVD , SO THIS IS A NEW UPLOAD\n\n\n\n6)  Part 6 \nThe Wartime Farm team tackle the conditions faced by British farmers in 1943, when food imports slumped to their lowest level during the war. The government feared a crisis and after four long years at war, Britain's farmers were challenged with somehow increasing food production yet again. There were renewed shortages of animal feed so Alex and Peter resort to producing a hay crop from grass in the church yard and use some clever 1940s technology to get the job done. With tasks mounting up on the farm, the team turn to a popular source of additional wartime labour - children. Children's harvest camps were set up by the Ministry of Agriculture to release kids from school during periods of urgent need on farms, and over 70,000 pupils took part, paid six pence an hour to avoid accusations of exploitation. Ruth enlists eager child labour to collect herbs that were desperately needed by the pharmaceutical industry to make medicines during the war. But once the job's done, she has to feed them. Ruth discovers the methods women used to look good despite the restrictions of rationing. After making a new dress from old flour sacks, she gets a makeover from a pair of wartime hair and beauty experts. While Peter is getting to grips with a vintage hay baling machine, Ruth and Alex attend a party at the village hall, where they experience a new dance phenomenon brought to Britain by African-American GIs, the jive.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg http://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1578 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d2e70e518be2d1cc7b27b7cb3b8d86ec78f7b3","amp;dn":"BBC.Wartime.Farm.6of8.DVDrip.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d2e70e518be2d1cc7b27b7cb3b8d86ec78f7b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,210,231,14,81,139,226,209,204,123,39,183,203,59,141,134,236,120,247,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

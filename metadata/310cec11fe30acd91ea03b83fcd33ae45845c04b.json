THIS VERY INESCAPABILITY ITSELF IS MEDITATION: IF YOU GO FURTHER AND APPLY EFFORT TO EXAMINE YOURSELF, YOU'RE EVEN FURTHER AWAY.\r\nRIGHT WHEN YOU'RE IN SOMETHING INESCAPABLE, DO NOT BESTIR YOUR MIND AND THINK OF EXAMINING YOURSELF. THE PATRIARCH SAID, &quot;WHEN DISCRIMINATION DOESN'T ARISE, THE LIGHT OF EMPTINESS SHINES BY ITSELF.&quot; AGAIN, LAYMAN P'ANG SAID:\r\nIN DAILY ACTIVITIES WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION,\r\nI ALONE NATURALLY HARMONIZE.\r\nNOT GRASPING OR REJECTING ANYWHERE,\r\nNOT GOING WITH OR GOING AGAINST.\r\nWHO CONSIDERS CRIMSON AND PURPLE HONORABLE?\r\nTHERE'S NOT A SPECK OF DUST IN THE MOUNTAINS.\r\nSPIRITUAL POWERS AND WONDROUS FUNCTIONING:\r\nHAULING WATER AND CARRYING FIREWOOD.\r\nJUST WHEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE, SUDDENLY YOU GET RID OF THE CLOTH BAG (OF ILLUSION) AND WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT YOU WILL BE CLAPPING YOUR HANDS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY.\r\n\r\nThe inescapable... it is one of the most significant problems for every meditator.\r\nThere are things which will disappear as your meditation deepens. All that is false will be gone, all that is illusory will no longer exist; all that you have projected, expected, or dreamt will have no reality. But still there will be something left which is not your dream, which is not your projection, which is not the creation of your mind: this is called the inescapable. In other words, the real will remain -- only the false will be gone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310cec11fe30acd91ea03b83fcd33ae45845c04b","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Great+Zen+Master+Ta+Hui-24_The+Inescapable.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310cec11fe30acd91ea03b83fcd33ae45845c04b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,12,236,17,254,48,172,217,30,160,59,131,252,211,58,228,88,69,192,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

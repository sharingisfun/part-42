Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempt to save the planet's inhabitants from a volcanic eruption. When Spock's life is endangered, Kirk violates the Prime Directive to rescue him, thereby exposing the Enterprise to the planet's civilization. Kirk accuses Spock of showing little morality when they argue over the decision.\nSummoned to Earth, Kirk loses command of the Enterprise as a result of his decision and Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is reinstated as its commanding officer. When a secret Section 31 installation in London is bombed, Pike, Kirk and Spock meet with Starfleet commanders to discuss the hunt for the culprit, Starfleet agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), but Harrison attacks the meeting in a jumpship. Kirk destroys it, but Pike is killed and Harrison escapes by transporting to Kronos, the Klingon homeworld.\nAdmiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) reinstates Kirk as the Enterprise's captain with orders to kill Harrison, and he outfits the Enterprise with prototype photon torpedoes for the task. Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg) resigns in protest when his request to inspect the weapons is denied. Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is promoted to chief engineer and Dr. Carol Wallace (Alice Eve), a science officer with expertise in the new weapons, joins the crew. Spock, Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) convince Kirk that it would be better to capture and try, rather than kill, Harrison.\nKirk, Spock and Uhura fly to Kronos, with Spock and Uhura conflicted over his perceived lack of emotion. They try to capture the adept Harrison but are intercepted by Klingons. Harrison easily dispatches the Klingons, but surrenders to the crew after learning of the torpedoes. On the Enterprise, Harrison reveals himself as Khan, a genetically-engineered superhuman awoken by Marcus from a 300-year suspended animation.[10] Each torpedo is revealed to contain one of Khan's crew in a cryogenic pod, held hostage by Marcus to force Khan into developing weapons and starships for a war between the Federation and the Klingons.\nThe Enterprise is intercepted by a larger, unmarked Federation warship, the USS Vengeance, designed by Khan and commanded by Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but Kirk refuses. The Enterprise warps to Earth for Khan's trial, but is attacked by the Vengeance en route. Kirk offers to exchange Khan and the cryogenic pods for the lives of his crew. Carol reveals herself as Carol Marcus, the admiral's daughter, who joined the Enterprise in protest against her father. Marcus transports her to the Vengeance, revealing his intention to destroy the Enterprise and advance his plan to start a war with the Klingons. The Vengeance prepares to open fire, but it experiences a power outage caused by Scott, who infiltrated the ship to aid Kirk. With the transporters down, Kirk and Khan space-jump to the Vengeance. After seizing the bridge, Khan overpowers Scott, Kirk and Carol and kills Marcus.\nKhan negotiates with Spock, beaming Kirk and his boarding party back to the Enterprise in exchange for the prototype torpedoes. Spock hands over the torpedoes, having secretly removed Khan's frozen crew and arming their warheads. The delivered torpedoes incapacitate the Vengeance and both damaged starships fall towards Earth. A misalignment of the warp-core heads renders the Enterprise powerless, and Kirk sacrifices himself by entering the radioactive engine chamber to realigns them, thereby preventing the ship's destruction. Spock meets Kirk at the chamber's exit, but is unable to assist. After confessing their mutual feelings of friendship towards each other, Kirk succumbs to radiation poisoning. Grief-stricken, Spock orders the Enterprise to pursue and kill Khan.\nKhan crashes the Vengeance into San Francisco to destroy Starfleet's headquarters, but Spock transports down in pursuit. While experimenting on a tribble, McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. Spock and Uhura capture Khan, and Kirk is revived.\nA year later Kirk addresses a gathering memorializing the events, reciting his &quot;where no one has gone before&quot; speech. Khan is resealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his crew, while Carol joins a rebuilt Enterprise as it departs on a five-year mission.\n\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4300464e045c46d650353374f6ed40303115a12d","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Into+Darkness.2013.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4300464e045c46d650353374f6ed40303115a12d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,0,70,78,4,92,70,214,80,53,51,116,246,237,64,48,49,21,161,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

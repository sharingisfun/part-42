Orbicide band members say that nowadays dark electro became soft and lost a lot of its original harshness and energy. Thus, their own music is harsh, raw and unpolished. The release consists of 6 original songs and 6 remixes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03148ea49c71edd379fa01719e02c718d3160b8","amp;dn":"Dark+Electro-Orbicide-Ex+Falso+Quodlibet-2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03148ea49c71edd379fa01719e02c718d3160b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,49,72,234,73,199,30,221,55,159,160,23,25,224,44,113,141,49,96,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Miller&amp;#039;s death came about after he and fellow crew members were attempting to approach an Israeli APC at night time, audibly and visibly suggesting their neutrality as journalists by wearing helmets and flak vests marked &quot;TV&quot;, waving a white flag and walking slowly in the open. A first warning shot was fired by Israeli soldiers, and a crew member reaffirmed their neutrality by yelling &quot;We are British journalists&quot;. Seconds later, another shot was fired and hit Miller in the neck, killing him instantly. This occurred while the crew was filming military activity from one of the children&amp;#039;s homes in Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea9890a982ff3a4494b3b0963d52187ea9b0dca","amp;dn":"Death+in+Gaza+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea9890a982ff3a4494b3b0963d52187ea9b0dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,169,137,10,152,47,243,164,73,75,59,9,99,213,33,135,234,155,13,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

War with Germany is imminent. Rudyard Kipling(David Haig), the British Empire's greatest apologist, is at the peak of his literary fame. This movie explores the nature of a man who loses his balance when devotion to family and country clash. World War I breaks out, and Kipling's son, Jack (Daniel Radcliffe), is determined to fight, but the Army and the Navy both reject him because of his extremely poor eyesight. Undaunted, Kipling uses his influence to land Jack a commission in the Irish Guards, sparking off a bitter family conflict. Jack goes to war and is reported missing, believed wounded, in his first action. The Kipling family live in vain hope for two years, before finally learning of Jack's death. The effect on Kipling is profound and irrevocable, as he struggles to confront his appalling sense of guilt and loss.\n\n\n                      My.Boy.Jack.2007.STV.DVDRip.XviD-ELiA\n  37.\n                                                                           \n  38.\n          L++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-\n  39.\n                                                                           \n  40.\n       \n  41.\n       \n  42.\n            SUPPLiED BY    :  ELiA\n  43.\n            ENCODED BY     :  ELiA\n  44.\n            RELEASEDATE    :  14/03/2008\n  45.\n            DiSCS          :  1\n  46.\n            RUNTiME        :  1h 34m 42s\n  47.\n            FiLE SiZE      :  696,64MB : 49x15MB\n  48.\n            IMDB RATiNG    :  7.9/10 (300 votes)\n  49.\n       \n  50.\n       \n  51.\n           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851430/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851430/&lt;/a&gt;\n  52.\n       \n  53.\n       \n  54.\n            SOURCE         :  RETAiL PAL DVD\n  55.\n            ViDEO FORMAT   :  XViD\n  56.\n            FRAME RATE     :  25.0000 FPS\n  57.\n            ASPECT RATiO   :  592x336\n  58.\n            ViDEO BiTRATE  :  886,91kbps\n  59.\n            AUDiO FORMAT   :  128,51 kb/s VBR MP3\n  60.\n            AUDiO LANGUAGE :  ENGLiSH\n  61.\n            SUBTiTLES      :  GREEK\n  62.\n       \n  63.\n       \n  64.\n            Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Â¢                                                 \n  65.\n                                                                           \n  66.\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------\n  67.\n          ---------------------Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦    MoViE  iNFO   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦------------------------Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬\n  68.\n       \n  69.\n       \n  70.\n             Author Rudyard Kipling and his wife search for their 17-year-\n  71.\n             old son after he goes missing during WWI.\n  72.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c718302d3ac3e4f732299d06956b30593d542c2b","amp;dn":"My.Boy.Jack.2007.WS.PDTV.XviD-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c718302d3ac3e4f732299d06956b30593d542c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,24,48,45,58,195,228,247,50,41,157,6,149,107,48,89,61,84,44,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

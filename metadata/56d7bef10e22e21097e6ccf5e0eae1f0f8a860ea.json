After all, how many doctors make inappropriate toasts at their ex-boyfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding, nearly drown at the bottom of a strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pool and get arrested for disorderly conduct just moments before having to deliver a baby? Funny, impatient and politically incorrect, MINDY LAHIRI (Kaling) can quote every romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan that exists. She loves the good ones and the bad ones, because the girl always gets the guy. Mindy is determined to be more punctual, spend less money, lose weight and read more books Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all in pursuit of becoming a well-rounded perfect womanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦who can meet and date the perfect guy. Mindy is a skilled OB/GYN and shares a practice with a few other doctors, none of whom make life any easier for her. JEREMY REED (British writer/comedian Ed Weeks) is the walking definition of total bad news. He not only shares a practice with Mindy, but sometimes her bed as well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ despite her best efforts to resist. He is funny, self-absorbed and super sexy. In contrast, DANNY CASTELLANO (Chris Messina, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DamagesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is a hothead and guysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guy who has a habit of stealing MindyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patients. Danny criticizes her for everything, including her struggling love life and her lack of professionalism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious to everyone except Mindy that he secretly admires her work. His blue-collar childhood gives him a big chip on his shoulder, but he is a dedicated physician, which Mindy canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand to admit because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always getting on her case. Rounding out The Office staff are the receptionists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BETSY PUTCH (Zoe Jarman, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HugeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), young, earnest and easily excitable, who thinks the world of Mindy and is always trying to impress her; and SHAUNA DICANIO (newcomer Dana DeLorenzo), a self-assured Jersey Girl who is indifferent to Mindy, always knows where the cool party is and carries a poorly concealed torch for Danny. Mindy is in constant communication with her beloved best friend from college, GWEN GRANDY (Anna Camp, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Good WifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), who also happens to be the governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter. Gwen is a hilarious, sometimes too-blunt friend, and secretly a former carefree party girl (which only Mindy seems to remember). Although Gwen is now happily married to a financial analyst, with a six-year-old daughter, this lawyer-turned-Pilates mom remains squarely in MindyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corner. As Mindy attempts to get her career off the ground and meet a guy who passes her red flag test (no drug habits, no skinny jeans and no secret families, among others), only time will tell if she gets her romantic comedy ending.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d7bef10e22e21097e6ccf5e0eae1f0f8a860ea","amp;dn":"The.Mindy.Project.S01E18.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d7bef10e22e21097e6ccf5e0eae1f0f8a860ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,215,190,241,14,34,226,16,151,230,204,245,224,234,225,240,248,168,96,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

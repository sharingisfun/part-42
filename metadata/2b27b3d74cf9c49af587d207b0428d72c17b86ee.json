This series reveals why the county of his birth still remains for him a magical and mysterious ancient kingdom. He immerses himself in the unique experiences it has to offer, camping wild in the most remote spot in Britain, stargazing into the darkest skies in England and exploring the rich and deep history of a county which has its own flag, along with iconic locations such as Holy Island and Hadrian's Wall. Northumberland also boasts more castles than any other county as well as vast expanses of unspoilt countryside and a spectacular coastline, allowing Robson to encounter all walks of life from Lords and Ladies and fishermen, to Britain's youngest shepherdess.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nRobson explores the rich history and culture of his home county as he travels by land, sea and air, discovering the role Northumberland has played in shaping modern Britain. He begins by spending a day on the remote Farne Islands a few miles off the coast, meeting the National Trust rangers who look after one of the nation's largest bird colonies. He also returns to the port of Seahouses to reminisce about his childhood holidays.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nRobson ventures off the beaten track to explore the wilderness of the sparsely populated Northumberland National Park. After spending the night in a ramshackle hut, he meets 23-year-old Emma Grey, who has taken on the challenge of running one of the most remote farms in England. He also visits Kielder Observatory, a labour of love for bricklayer-turned-astronomer Gary Fildes.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nThe actor travels along an idyllic stretch of coastline to find out how Northumberland's past shaped modern Britain. He also follows the `Pilgrims' Way' walking route to Lindisfarne, goes swimming with grey seals at the Farne Islands, and learns how Bamburgh Castle was once the stronghold of the ancient kings of Northumbria.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nRobson discovers how Northumberland's border with Scotland has shaped British history. He visits Berwick-upon-Tweed, a town that changed allegiance 13 times during the bloody battles of the middle Ages, and attends an event commemorating the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Flodden. He also drops in on a training session with Berwick Rangers, the only English football team to play in the Scottish league.\n\n5)  Part 5 \nThe actor learns more about Northumberland's customs and proud sense of regional identity. He goes fishing for sea salmon in a coble boat, a design that dates back hundreds of years, and visits the Rothbury Traditional Music Festival, where he meets a group of young poets keeping the local dialect alive. He also talks to Kathryn Tickell, who has taken the music of the Northumbrian smallpipes and fiddle to a global audience.\n\n6)  Part 6 \nRobson finds out how Northumberland's history and heritage is being reinvented for the modern age. His first stop is Alnwick Castle, the ancestral home of the Percy family and famous for doubling as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films. He then visits a railway station-turned-bookshop, where he learns the story of the Keep Calm and Carry On wartime slogan, and finally, makes his way to one of the region's newest landmarks, the giant land sculpture Northumberlandia, known as The Lady of the North.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nThe actor meets the current residents of stately home Howick Hall - the descendants of 19th-century prime minister Charles Grey - and learns about the history of Earl Grey tea. Next, at the fishing village of Craster, he visits one of the region's last traditional smokehouses, and finally, performs as part of a band created for one night only in a thriving Northumbrian pub.\n\n8)  Part 8 \nRobson Green rounds off his journey by visiting three landmarks that have played a key role in Northumbrian and British history. He begins at Hadrian's Wall, where he camps overnight and learns how the Romans transformed the nation's culture, before moving on to Kielder Water, the biggest man-made lake in northern Europe. Robson's final stop is his home town of Hexham, where he learns about the turbulent past of Hexham Abbey and discovers the secrets of its Anglo-Saxon crypts.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3341/6ba4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3341/6ba4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/2535/n4tm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/2535/n4tm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/3850/t3bf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/3850/t3bf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9216/yp03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9216/yp03.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9360/6guf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9360/6guf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/8793/9to4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/8793/9to4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6648/b2d7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6648/b2d7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7240/m02v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7240/m02v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8186/m3rj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8186/m3rj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1d55747a755d5129332c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1967 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 23mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 312 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/tv-review-tales-from-northumberland-with-robson-green-itv-8909483.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/tv-review-tales-from-northumberland-with-robson-green-itv-8909483.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b27b3d74cf9c49af587d207b0428d72c17b86ee","amp;dn":"Tales+From+Northumberland+With+Robson+Green+2of8+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b27b3d74cf9c49af587d207b0428d72c17b86ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,39,179,215,76,249,196,154,245,135,210,7,176,66,141,114,193,123,134,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

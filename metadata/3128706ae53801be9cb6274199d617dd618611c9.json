These four, yearning for true love, live in a steampunk-inspired 19th century of mechanical butlers, extraterrestrial-worshiping cults, and airborne debutante balls. Their passions alone would be enough to consume them-but when a secret cabal of radical scientific revolutionaries launches an attack on Russian high society's high-tech lifestyle, our heroes must fight back with all their courage, all their gadgets, and all the power of a sleek new cyborg model like nothing the world has ever seen.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 19 hours and 10 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Random House Audio\nAudible.com Release Date: June 8, 2010\nWhispersync for Voice: Ready\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B003QL14EQ\n\n\nSusan Duerden (Narrator)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3128706ae53801be9cb6274199d617dd618611c9","amp;dn":"Android+Karenina+by+Ben+Win","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3128706ae53801be9cb6274199d617dd618611c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,40,112,106,229,56,1,190,156,182,39,65,153,214,23,221,97,134,17,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Trained in a secret government program (enabling elite agents to telepathically get into the minds of killers,) O'Ryan himself is hunting down what he has labeled the ultimate serial killer and manifestation of evil - Suspect Zero.\n\nMackelway, now reunited with his former partner (Carrie-Anne Moss), must determine if O'Ryan's ability to identify with the murderers has turned him into the same type of monster he is trying to bring to justice.  Could O'Ryan be Suspect Zero?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a2570ae733804653c1d8617ec11d9fb2c77fc9","amp;dn":"Suspect+Zero+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a2570ae733804653c1d8617ec11d9fb2c77fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,162,87,10,231,51,128,70,83,193,216,97,126,193,29,159,178,199,127,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

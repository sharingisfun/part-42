Mr. Rock 'n' Roll showed the world that he was still &quot;The King&quot; ! We have an excellent set list with no weak spot. The crowd surely had just one happy hour they would never forget. Elvis` long-time friend Tom Jones was in the audience, too. Perhaps this fact encouraged Elvis even more. Fantastic ! (Ciscoking).  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39290c16c7f976dded67cb1a9a0c86ca59dc3505","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Hot+August+night+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39290c16c7f976dded67cb1a9a0c86ca59dc3505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,41,12,22,199,249,118,221,237,103,203,26,154,12,134,202,89,220,53,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

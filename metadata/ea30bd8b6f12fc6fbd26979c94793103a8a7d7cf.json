If you missed it the first time around, grab it now, because heaven only knows how long it will remain available. Koechlinâ€™s series of works based on Kiplingâ€™s The Jungle Book consists of five evocative and remarkable pieces: Three Poems, Op. 18, The Spring Running, The Meditation of Purun Bhagat, The Law of the Jungle, and Les Bandar-log. This last is the best known of the group, and the entire series has been recorded at least three times.\r\nThis is far and away the best version of the lot: extremely well played, incisively conducted, and very well recorded. It also includes the Three Poems of Op. 18, which are absolutely, ridiculously, insanely gorgeous and you wonâ€™t believe that they almost never get performed. They are very well sung by mezzo-soprano Iris Vermillion, tenor Johan Botha, and bass Ralf Lukas. Today, you can also get them on the two-disc set of Koechlinâ€™s complete orchestral songs issued by HÃ¤nssler Classic, but itâ€™s particularly good to have them paired with the other Jungle Book pieces.\r\nThe opening Seal Lullaby (Berceuse phoque) offers a good idea of what to expect. Now admit itâ€“you want it. You have to own it. You canâ€™t live without it. Go for it.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\nCD 1\r\nTrois poÃ¨mes, Op. 18*\r\n1. Berceuse phoque\r\n2.

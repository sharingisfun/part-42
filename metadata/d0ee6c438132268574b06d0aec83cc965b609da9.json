Carol Anne Freeling \n(Heather O'Rourke) is now 12 years old and living with Patricia and Bruce \nGardner (Nancy Allen and Tom Skerritt), her aunt and uncle, in a high-rise \napartment building in downtown Chicago. Carol Anne attends a school for gifted \nchildren, where the staff psychologist Dr. Seaton (Richard Fine) attributes her \npast troubles with noisy ghosts to mass delusions and hypnotic suggestions. \nHowever, Carol Anne isn't so sure that the explanation is that simple, \nespecially since she still sees threatening apparitions in the mirrors of her \napartment. Particularly troubling is the ghost of the wicked Reverend Kane \n(Nathan Davis), who is eager for Carol Anne to join him and his followers in the \nunknown world on the other side of the light. Sadly, Heather O'Rourke died due \nto surgical complications resulting from an intestinal blockage several months \nbefore Poltergeist III was released. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Some Reviews\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs reviews on this movie are indeed very negative, I've picked some not-so-\nnegative coommentaries from people on IMDB.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJ_MALICE FROM LOUISVILLE, KY\n\nGoing in a different direction from the previous two movies in the series, this \none took a few chances. The high-rise, mirrors, a new Kane(sad what happened to \nJulian Beck), etc. I loved this movie for those reasons. Not saying I didn't \nenjoy the other two because those were excellent, but it seemed like there \nwasn't anything in there to make them considered a horror movie except for the \npresence of ghosts with a little bit of suspense. &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; contained \nmurder, suspense, tricky camera angles and most of all, the best acting I have \never seen from Heather O'Rourke. She was so adorable in her red pajamas and I \ntruly believe she carried the movie with up to par performances by Skeritt, \nAllen, Rubenstein, Fire, Flynn Boyle and Wentz. Her presence on screen while \nwatching this movie is so magnificent and very believable. When I was little, \nshe was my first crush and I loved her, I only found out on 6-4-2005 that she \npassed away and it crushed me. I say this is the best of the series and I know I \nam the minority, but hey, to each his own. I realize the first movie is pretty \nmuch legendary for her famous line &quot;They're Here&quot;, but I feel the acting here is \nbetter. The way they made the concept of the mirrors work is amazing and I \nthought it was a great attempt a something new. I gave this movie a 9/10 because \nof how much I enjoyed Heather O'Rourke's performance. Check it out. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndrhackenstine from United States\n\nStrange little sequel filled with annoying characters and some horrible dialog. \nPoltergeist 3 is not really all that bad, it just suffers greatly from those two \nflaws. Story does wisely by switching the setting from the suburbs to the big \ncity. The character Carol Anne now resides with her aunt and uncle and snobby \ncousin in Chicago, where they live in a high rise. Soon, ghosts start popping up \nagain. This movie has some of the stupidest lines in it, it's often hard not to \ngrin. O'Rourke did a good acting job in the first two films. Here, not so good. \nI think that may be the fault of whoever wrote the go-nowhere script. A lot of \nthe characters lines in this seem forced or overacted. Especially the character \nof Dr. Seaton. The special effects are impressive though. The makers used a lot \nof mirror tricks that really pull the movie through it's stupider moments. \nHowever, the chopped off head of Kane scene was atrocious. I guess this movie \nsuffered because of severe budget cuts.A lot of scenes in this movie feel a bit \nlame(the kid who busts up through the ice and runs into the window, the &quot;break \nthe mirror&quot; scene,the kid who flips off the security camera, etc., etc.). Nancy \nAllen, who plays the aunt, does not look happy to be involved in this. Weaker \nentry in the series, but it is watchable. Seems a bit rushed. Features annoying \nteenagers you would find in a Friday The 13th movie. A guy rips off Lara Flynn \nBoyle's cheek. And whats with that growling window pane in the end? Ya gotta see \nit if you saw the first two. Two stars. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nnick-ccr from United States\n\nOkay, now its Poltergeist III. The only two returning actresses are Heather \nO'Rourke and Zelda Rubenstein. Its about Carol Anne who moved to her aunt \n(played by Nancy Allen) and uncle's (played by Tom Skerrit) high rise apartment \nbuilding. Her aunt and uncle's daughter (played by Lara Flynn Boyle) lives there \ntoo. Carol Anne finds out that Reverend Kane (from the 2nd movie) has returned \nto make her lead him into the light, and the more she doesn't, the more friends \nof hers will get killed.\n\nThe acting is terrible mostly but Heather O'Rourke does an excellent job in her \nlast performance and Lara Flynn Boyle also does very good. Tom Skerrit didn't do \ntoo good in this one and neither did Nancy Allen. Reverend Kane doesn't even \nlook like himself. The special effects were very good and the use of mirrors was \nalso really cool. The part where the kids were sneaking around was the most \nintense part of the movie because the movie is not intense. Richard Fire was \natrocious as Dr. Seaton and him denying everything just goes way too far. The \nmovie is entertaining and fun. The ending was somewhat abrupt because Heather \nO'Rourke was dead before filming finished. An average sequel and an okay way to \nend the story.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is intended to be played on a PC or a HTPC.

And yet here we have Vince Gill, who has not only released 4 albums simultaneously (a feat not even matched by Prince), but also had a hand in writing all 43 songs.\n\nAs many admirers as Gill has (myself included), none would have considered him an artistic force. Maybe it&amp;#039;s time to change that. As with any sprawling project, there are some duds, but there are also plenty of gems. \n\nInformaciÃƒÂ³n Disco:\n\n? Artista: Vince Gill\n?

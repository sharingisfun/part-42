Devil On My Shoulder\n\nCredits: Show\n\nPonderosa are a new band, but not a band feeling its way to a mature sound and style -- Ponderosa are already fully developed on Moonlight Revival, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album on New West Records. Sounding at times like a blend of the Black Crowes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Tom Petty, all with just a dash of country tossed in, this Atlanta-based band delivers first-rate songs with verve, joy, energy, and attitude, due in no small part to lead singer Kalen Nash's poised and assured vocals. Everything works here -- the vocals, the guitars, the little piano touches. The opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old Gin Road,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ could play anywhere on todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radio dial, from new country stations to alternative rock stations. It features crisp guitars, great hooks, and a solid lead vocal from Nash, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no accident that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first single. But it might not even be the best song on the album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mind&quot; is just as good, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pretty People,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ driven by a Stones-like guitar riff and British Invasion harmonies, is arguably even better. Oh, and then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Revolution,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which sounds like the rocking political song Tom Petty has always wanted to write, and the warm, back-porch folk/bluegrass feel of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Penniless,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which shows just how versatile and talented this band is. These guys are the real deal, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve arrived fully formed. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to imagine a better debut album this year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d7862b11e1d03124ae3c614fcbe59f78b6309cd","amp;dn":"Ponderosa+-+Moonlight+Revival+%5B2010%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d7862b11e1d03124ae3c614fcbe59f78b6309cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,120,98,177,30,29,3,18,74,227,198,20,252,190,89,247,139,99,9,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

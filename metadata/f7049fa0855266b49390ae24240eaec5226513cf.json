Several tracks that stand out are Photographic, Nodisco, New Life (Presented here in the original version and not the remix like on previous US versions of Speak &amp; Spell), and Just Can't Get Enough, but all in all the entire album sounds great. The second disc, a DVD which includes a 5.1 version of the album, b-sides from the singles from the album, and a 30 minute documentary with rare footage of the band and interviews with everyone from Vince Clarke to Daniel Miller.\n\nThere is no reason to give this album bad reviews based on minor techinal details. The songs are great like before and the album sounds better than it ever has. Well worth it to fans of Depeche Mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7049fa0855266b49390ae24240eaec5226513cf","amp;dn":"paleangel-depeche+mode+%281981%29+speak+and+spell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7049fa0855266b49390ae24240eaec5226513cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,4,159,160,133,82,102,180,147,144,174,36,36,14,174,197,34,101,19,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

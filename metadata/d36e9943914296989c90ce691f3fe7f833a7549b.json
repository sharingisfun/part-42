The band spent much of 2012 on the road, including an appearance on the Van's Warped Tour, at which they'll be appearing again in 2013, followed by heavy national touring on their own, both as a headliner and support act. The band also has co-writer and co-production credits on B.O.B.'s Strange Clouds with the track Chandelier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d36e9943914296989c90ce691f3fe7f833a7549b","amp;dn":"Super+Water+Sympathy+-+Hydrogen+Child+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d36e9943914296989c90ce691f3fe7f833a7549b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,110,153,67,145,66,150,152,156,144,206,105,31,63,231,248,51,167,84,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

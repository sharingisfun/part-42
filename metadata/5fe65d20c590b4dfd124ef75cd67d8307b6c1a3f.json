The genius of Claire Harmanâ€™s biography is that it transcends these melancholy facts to reveal a woman for whom duty and piety gave way to quiet rebellion and fierce ambition.\r\n\r\nDrawing on letters unavailable to previous biographers, Harman depicts Charlotteâ€™s inner life with absorbing, almost novelistic intensity. She seizes upon a moment in Charlotteâ€™s adolescence that ignited her determination to reject poverty and obscurity: While working at a girlsâ€™ school in Brussels, Charlotte fell in love with her married professor, Constantin Heger, a man who treated her as â€œnothing special to him at all.â€ She channeled her torment into her first attempts at a novel and resolved to bring it to the world's attention.\r\n\r\nCharlotte helped power her sistersâ€™ work to publication, too. But Emilyâ€™s Wuthering Heights was eclipsed by Jane Eyre, which set London abuzz with speculation: Who was this fiery author demanding love and justice for her plain and insignificant heroine? Charlotte BrontÃ«â€™s blazingly intelligent women brimming with hidden passions would transform English literature. And she savored her literary success even as a heartrending series of personal losses followed.\r\n\r\nCharlotte BrontÃ« is a groundbreaking view of the beloved writer as a young woman ahead of her time. Shaped by Charlotteâ€™s lifelong struggle to claim love and art for herself, Harmanâ€™s richly insightful biography offers readers many of the pleasures of BrontÃ«â€™s own work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe65d20c590b4dfd124ef75cd67d8307b6c1a3f","amp;dn":"Charlotte+Bronte+-+A+Fiery+Heart+-+Claire+Harman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe65d20c590b4dfd124ef75cd67d8307b6c1a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,230,93,32,197,144,180,223,209,36,239,117,205,103,216,48,123,108,26,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Offit, M.D., offers a scathing exposÃ© of the alternative medicine industry, revealing how even though some popular therapies are remarkably helpful due to the placebo response, many of them are ineffective, expensive, and even deadly.\r\n\r\nDr. Offit reveals how alternative medicineâ€”an unregulated industry under no legal obligation to prove its claims or admit its risksâ€”can actually be harmful to our health.\r\n\r\nUsing dramatic real-life stories, Offit separates the sense from the nonsense, showing why any therapyâ€”alternative or traditionalâ€”should be scrutinized. He also shows how some nontraditional methods can do a great deal of good, in some cases exceeding therapies offered by conventional practitioners.\r\n\r\nAn outspoken advocate for science-based health advocacy who is not afraid to take on media celebrities who promote alternative practices, Dr. Offit advises, â€œThereâ€™s no such thing as alternative medicine. Thereâ€™s only medicine that works and medicine that doesnâ€™t.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249fadd92e349a7364ef1bb6c1d46f3b52c96e76","amp;dn":"Do+You+Believe+in+Magic%3F%3A+The+Sense+and+Nonsense+of+Alternative+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249fadd92e349a7364ef1bb6c1d46f3b52c96e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,159,173,217,46,52,154,115,100,239,27,182,193,212,111,59,82,201,110,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

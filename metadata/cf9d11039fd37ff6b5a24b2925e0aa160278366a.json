Between 1961 and 1971, chart-toppers like Etta James, Fontella Bass, Little Milton, and the Dells kept enough money rolling in to leverage the stronger, but weaker-selling, blues side of Chess. Crucial cuts by all these acts can be found in this two-CD compilation along with fine work from many lesser-knowns. Chess preferred the softer side of soul with string arrangements (the Gems' &quot;I Can't Help Myself,&quot; the Knight Brothers' &quot;Temptation 'Bout to Get Me&quot;), but they managed to balance out their catalog with some sweatier material (Etta James and Sugar Pie DeSanto's &quot;Do I Make Myself Clear,&quot; Laura Lee's &quot;Dirty Man&quot;). Highlights include Jan Bradley's sugar-sweet &quot;Mama Didn't Lie,&quot; the Kolettes' punchy &quot;Who's That Guy,&quot; Maurice &amp; Mac's propulsive &quot;You Left the Water Running,&quot; and (of course) the Fontella Bass classic &quot;Rescue Me.&quot; This probably should have been expanded into a box set, but there's more than enough first-class music here to make it a must-have for soul fans. --Ken Hohman\n\nDisc 1: \n01.

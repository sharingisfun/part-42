It is a call-in and variety show hosted by Chris Gethard that airs every Wednesday night at 11:00PM on MNN and on a live stream at the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website. The Public access television show is written and produced by Noah Forman, Dru Johnston, J.D. Amato and Chris Gethard. It is directed by J.D. Amato. The show, known for its &quot;no cool kids&quot; atmosphere, has been called &quot;oddly uplifting&quot;, a &quot;cult hit,&quot; &quot;an often riveting experiment in seat-of-your-pants broadcasting,&quot; and has gained viewers from around the world.

Either way, here's some more for y'all... \n\nMore old games that are pretty hard to locate. Some are dead for a reason (they suck!) but some are pretty good. I make no apologies for the quality of some of these, I'm just filling the gaps. If you don't like it, well, it was free, and you know where the delete button is! :-) \n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Basketball Hall of Fame - Ultimate Hoops Challenge [SHFE20] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Sports - Basketball\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (I have my uTorrent set to 1000%/10.0 !!) \nDo not just leech and run - help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help, please try to seed for as long as you can.\n\nIf you like it, maybe buy a Wii game that is not in my list, or here on TPB and upload it for the rest of us to have too - Thanks! :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 800+ Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search it and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all Wii games out there...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71732c301d2157bcb0ef6329f02abf0893a0481","amp;dn":"Wii+Basketball+Hall+of+Fame+-+Ultimate+Hoops+Challenge+%5BSHFE20%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71732c301d2157bcb0ef6329f02abf0893a0481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,23,50,195,1,210,21,123,203,14,246,50,159,2,171,240,137,58,4,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

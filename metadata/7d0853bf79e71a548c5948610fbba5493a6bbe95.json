Cannonball's music in this period is marked by his enthusiastic embrace of funk and jazz rock. In addition to his brother Nat Adderley on trumpet, the quintet included Joe Zawinul on piano, Victor Gaskin on bass, and Louis Hayes on drums. \n\nIn addition to the leader's hot and exciting alto playing, what stand out are Hayes's aggressive and effective drumming and Zawinul's contributions in terms of two original compositions (the odd-meter, free jazz-oriented &quot;Scavenger&quot; and the funky &quot;Walk Tall&quot;) and his solo performance of &quot;Ballads Medley.&quot; The generosity of the leader extended to Gaskin as well, who was prominently featured on &quot;Manha De Carnaval.&quot;\n\n\nNewly remastered in Japan based on the original mono master tapes, this reissue CD is an important document of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1969 and a must-have item for his fans!. This Japanese reissue CD released by Studio Songs in May 2014. Mono.\n\nRecorded live in Milan, 1969. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Scavenger\n02 - Sweet Emma\n03 - Ballads Medley\n04 - This Here\n05 - Manha De Carnaval\n06 - Walk Tall\n\n*2014 Studio Songs Japan | YZSO-10041 {2014 Japan Studio Songs Remaster}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJulian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley (alto sax)\nNat Adderley (cornet)\nJoe Zawinul (electric piano, piano)\nVictor Gaskin (bass)\nLouis Hayes (drums)\n\n\n\nCannonball Adderley - The Black Messiah (1972) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10678764/Cannonball_Adderley_-_The_Black_Messiah_%281972%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10678764/Cannonball_Adderley_-_The_Black_Messiah_%281972%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, Seed and Sharing.

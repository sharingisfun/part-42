It was recorded on Supertramp's Breakfast in America tour in Paris, France, with most of the tracks taken from a 29 November 1979 show at the Pavillon de Paris, a venue which was once a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe original master tapes of the album were rediscovered in the barn of the band's drummer Bob Siebenberg, along with video footage. The tapes were initially in bad technical shape, but were successfully transferred and digitally remastered.\n\nThis is the remastered CD version of the original album released on 30 July 2002.\n\nA mixture of hits and deep album cuts, this is Supertramp at their prime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afd89dfc8de1d6fcc4a30b8bc91f64dd04738cd","amp;dn":"Supertramp+-+Paris+Live+%281980%29+%282002+remaster%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afd89dfc8de1d6fcc4a30b8bc91f64dd04738cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,253,137,223,200,222,29,111,204,74,48,184,188,145,246,77,208,71,56,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

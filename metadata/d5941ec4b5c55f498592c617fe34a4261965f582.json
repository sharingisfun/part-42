The journal encourages contributions describing research at the interface of drug discovery and drug development.\r\nScientific areas within the scope of the journal include physical and pharmaceutical chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics, molecular and cellular biology, and polymer and materials science as they relate to drug and drug delivery system efficacy. Mechanistic Drug Delivery and Drug Targeting research on modulating activity and efficacy of a drug or drug product is within the scope of Molecular Pharmaceutics. Theoretical and experimental peer-reviewed communications, full-length research papers, brief articles, and critical reviews are welcomed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5941ec4b5c55f498592c617fe34a4261965f582","amp;dn":"Molecular+Pharmaceutics+%282004-2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5941ec4b5c55f498592c617fe34a4261965f582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,148,30,196,181,197,95,73,133,146,198,23,254,52,164,38,25,101,245,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Personally I don't understand why people bother with anything less - in the age of broadband Internet and huge ass hard drives...\n\nThe disc was copy-protected but the protection seems like a joke to me.  I made an image using Nero, then mounted the image with Daemon tools, and ripped using EAC.  Even if they could get the protection to work 100%, it would only hurt them, since most buyers (including me) expect to be able to rip the CDs they buy to MP3 to play them on ipods or car MP3 decks or whatever...  Anyway I'll get off my soapbox now.\n\nIf you like this CD please buy it to support the artists like I did.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b165d782fe79ebac21b2ee65b57f19f7ab2796f","amp;dn":"Coldplay+%3A+X+and+Y+%28320+kbps+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b165d782fe79ebac21b2ee65b57f19f7ab2796f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,22,93,120,47,231,158,186,194,27,46,230,91,87,241,159,122,178,121,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

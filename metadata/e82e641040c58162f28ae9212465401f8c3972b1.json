How the home gym and home office are linked to the womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health movement and home-based businesses. Why the refrigerator has trumped the stove as the crucial appliance. How every major hotel chain in the world has redesigned rooms and services for the female business traveler. Why some malls, appealing to women, are succeeding while others fail. What women look for online and why some retail websites, like Amazon, attract women while other sites turn them off.\n\n&quot;The point is,&quot; writes Underhill, &quot;while men were busy doing other things, women were becoming a major social, cultural, and economic force.&quot;\n\nAnd, as he warns, no business can afford to ignore their power and presence.\n\nWashington Post Review\n\nWhat do women want? Retail consultant Paco Underhill has a few suggestions, starting with: cleanliness, control, safety and considerateness. These concepts can be embodied in tidy dressing rooms, car sound systems that let drivers adjust the bass, and hotels that write a guest's room number on their keycard's envelope rather than announcing it loudly at the check-in desk.\n\nIn &quot;What Women Want,&quot; Underhill addresses how the market has adapted -- or not -- to women's changing social, cultural and economic status. For example, the modern woman doesn't have time to spend two hours working out or three or four hours on shopping. Ergo, the home gym and the death of the department store. But when they do shop, women like to make the best use of their time. Malls anchored by grocery stores and other offerings besides shopping (i.e., live music or a gym) might be the retail centers of the future, Underhill suggests. His classic example of a mall that does it all is the Grove in Los Angeles, which, with its own streetcar and open-air farmers' market, is not just a shopping center but a replication of the urban experience.\n\nUnderhill doesn't pretend to be a gender expert: &quot;I'm just a boy writing about girls.&quot; But the mass marketplace is all about generalizations, and he makes plenty of them. In the end he believes that women and men don't want vastly different things -- just that female customers are on the whole more demanding.\n\n&quot;By walking the female path,&quot; Underhill writes, &quot;you end up making things better for women and men.&quot; For example, he argues that women are more concerned with cleanliness than men. For that reason, a business place that appears messy might repel women but have less of an effect on men. But by bringing the place up to women's higher standards, you're likely to please both genders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82e641040c58162f28ae9212465401f8c3972b1","amp;dn":"Paco+Underhill+-+What+Women+Want+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82e641040c58162f28ae9212465401f8c3972b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,46,100,16,64,197,129,98,242,138,233,33,36,101,64,31,140,57,114,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

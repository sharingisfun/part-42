The compilation was a chart success in the United Kingdom, peaking at number three. In the United States it only managed to reach number 112 on the Billboard Top 200. It did achieve platinum status. Although a compilation, the album included two new songs: &quot;The Strangest Party (These Are the Times)&quot;, and &quot;Deliver Me&quot;.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Steve Gdula - In the wake of Michael Hutchence's tragic death, INXS's Greatest Hits seems sadly ironic in that it is, in part, a fitting eulogy and biography. No doubt about it, Hutchence gave the band its charisma, its sensuality, and also its funk appeal. So what if he couldn't dance? His phrasing and sense of timing were more than half of the rhythm behind &quot;Need You Tonight,&quot; &quot;What You Need,&quot; and &quot;New Sensation.&quot; He even gave Mick Jagger a run for his money with &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and &quot;Suicide Blonde.&quot; As a band, INXS were a finely honed machine, even from the beginning new-wave horns of &quot;The One Thing&quot; to the more orchestral &quot;Never Tear Us Apart.&quot; The collection also contains two unreleased tracks, but, interestingly enough, the transcending and powerful &quot;Don't Change&quot; is nowhere to be found.\n\nTrack Listings  \n\n[01] The One Thing\n[02] Original Sin\n[03] What You Need\n[04] Listen Like Thieves\n[05] Shine Like It Does\n[06] Need You Tonight\n[07] Devil Inside\n[08] New Sensation\n[09] Never Tear Us Apart\n[10] Suicide Blonde\n[11] Disappear\n[12] The Stairs\n[13] Heaven Sent\n[14] Beautiful Girl\n[15] The Strangest Party (These Are The Times)\n[16] Deliver Me\t\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:59m:56s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 148mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 31 May 1994\nRecord Company\t&gt; Atlantic Recordings\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.inxs.com\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INXS\n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/i/inxs.html\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/inxs\n\t&gt;[New Sensation]\n\t&gt;[Need You Tonight]\n\t&gt;[Never Tear Us Apart]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b2f89535dcf81b59e96ece742000b42f8ece150","amp;dn":"%5B1994%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+INXS+148mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b2f89535dcf81b59e96ece742000b42f8ece150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,47,137,83,93,207,129,181,158,150,236,231,66,0,11,66,248,236,225,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Filme muito sensÃƒÂ­vel. O diretor foi muito feliz em todas as escolhas.\n\nHÃƒÂ¥kon Liu's second short film &quot;Lucky Blue&quot; is a relatively simple affair - boy meets boy at a camping site somewhere in Sweden and their mutual love interest is triggered. The film, however, also has a parallell dimension - a karaoke song contest among the trailer people which is what gives this film its comic relief aspect, especially if you are familiar with the Swedish society and its love of cheesy pop culture, be it American country evergreens, Eurotrash or home grown musical pearls. The result is quite entertaining. As it's a short film, I won't give away too many details, but you may want to pay attention to the main karaoke guy's hairdo and the contestants' choice of songs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb01d3b5fb6c4f4b023fde9ee4f846d64453def0","amp;dn":"Lucky+Blue+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb01d3b5fb6c4f4b023fde9ee4f846d64453def0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,1,211,181,251,108,79,75,2,63,222,158,228,248,70,214,68,83,222,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

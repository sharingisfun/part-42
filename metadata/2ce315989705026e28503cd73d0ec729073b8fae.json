Vaughan and Adrian Alphona fully sorted out in chronological order. \n\nI couldn't find an fully complete series with every issue and in chronological order so I decided to make one my myself. The only issue I wasn't able to collect was &quot;Breaking into comics the marvel way! #01: Its not lupus!&quot; simply because no matter what site I used the torrent wouldn't download. If anyone has this issue and would like to upload it to something like mediafire for me to download and update that would be great. \n\nEverything is ordered in folders part 1-18. This is the correct chronological order according to the marvel fan wiki. I'll do my best to seed it as much as I can your best bet is to start around 10-12am Est as I'll make sure to start seeding every night when I go to bed. \n\nEnjoy and remember,\n\nTake my advice. When the world goes crazy you run...You runaway. - Nico Minoru (Sister Grimm) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce315989705026e28503cd73d0ec729073b8fae","amp;dn":"Runaways+Complete+Series+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce315989705026e28503cd73d0ec729073b8fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,227,21,152,151,5,2,110,40,80,60,215,61,14,199,41,7,59,143,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

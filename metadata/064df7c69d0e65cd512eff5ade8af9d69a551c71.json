Much of his early work, in fact, was considered ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“anti-communistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and remained unseen for years. It was not until 1996 that he produced his first internationally acclaimed feature, Mother and Son.\n\nSonata for Hitler could broadly be described as an experimental piece although Sokurov is very clear about distancing himself from avant-garde filmmakers. Perhaps because of his early experiences of censorship, Sokurov is famously reticent about the concrete meanings to his films and has often been quoted as saying (of cinema) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“too much importance is put on words\\\\\\'. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ImpressionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are what have remained important in SokurovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work.\n\nSokurov is a Cannes Film Festival regular, four of his movies having debuted there. His most commercially and critically successful film to date has been a semi-documentary Russian Ark (2002), acclaimed primarily for its visually hypnotic images contained within a single, unedited, shot.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-256710.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-256710.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-86468.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-86468.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------not my rip------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..................: 146,843,648\nRuntime ...................................: 0:10:01\n\nVideo Codec ...........................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ..............................: 576 x 464 (AR: 1.24)\nFPS .........................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...........................: 1690 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...........................: 0.253\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC......: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...........................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ............................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...........................: 224 kb/s tot, stereo (2/0), CBR\nNo. of audio streams ...............: 1 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.

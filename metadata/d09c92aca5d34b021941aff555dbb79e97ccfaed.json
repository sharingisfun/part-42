Angela del Toro knows pain: Her uncle Hector Ayala, the former White Tiger, killed. Her FBI partner, murdered. Her career, ruined. Her mentor, Matt Murdock, jailed. And the hurt is just beginning....The Yakuza's bloodthirsty Sano Orii returns, a genocidal shadow organization appears, and a new-but-old super-powered madman is looking to put the squeeze on White Tiger. Armed with mystical amulets---and finally in costume---White Tiger demands answers! But will she survive long enough to ask the right questions?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09c92aca5d34b021941aff555dbb79e97ccfaed","amp;dn":"White+Tiger+%28001+-+006%29+%282007%29+%28Digital%29+%28AnPymGold-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09c92aca5d34b021941aff555dbb79e97ccfaed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,156,146,172,165,211,75,2,25,65,175,245,85,219,183,158,151,204,250,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

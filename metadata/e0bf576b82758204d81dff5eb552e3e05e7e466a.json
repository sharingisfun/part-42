Until now, creation scientists have not had a satisfactory answer to this puzzle, but the new cosmology outlined in this book offers a fresh and scientifically sound solution. Though he challenges some traditional creationist theories, Dr. Humphreys takes Scripture very straightforwardly, upholding its inerrancy and the idea of a young universe as he explains days one through four of creation week.\n\nThis book not only contains an easy-to-read popular summary of this new cosmology, but also two technical papers which were very well received at the Third International Conference on Creationism. In this enlightening book Dr. Humphreys answers questions such as:\n\n-How do you explain distant starlight in a young universe?\n-How should a creationist answer the challenges that arise when faced with traditional cosmology?\n-DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t distant starlight prove evolution?\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr Humphreys was born on 2 February 1942 in Wyandotte, Michigan, U.S.A., and was raised in a scientifically aware but nonÃ¢â‚¬â€œChristian household. Not surprisingly, Russell himself always had a love for science, and in 1959, he was one of the 40 winners of the Westinghouse National Science Talent Search.\nHe received a B.S. degree in physics at Duke University, 1959Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963. After this, he moved to Louisiana State University (LSU) to study postgraduate physics. In 1969, while doing his dissertation research for LSU in the mountains of Colorado, he committed his life to Christ. In 1972, he was awarded a Ph.D. in physics, on cosmic rays and ultrahigh energy nucleonÃ¢â‚¬â€œnucleon interactions, by which time he was a fully convinced creationist due to both the biblical and scientific evidence. For the next 6 years he worked in the High Voltage Laboratory of General Electric Company, designing and inventing equipment and researching highÃ¢â‚¬â€œvoltage phenomena. While there, he received a U.S. patent and one of Industrial Research MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IRÃ¢â‚¬â€œ100 awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0bf576b82758204d81dff5eb552e3e05e7e466a","amp;dn":"Starlight+And+Time+-+Dr.+D.+Russell+Humphreys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0bf576b82758204d81dff5eb552e3e05e7e466a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,191,87,107,130,117,130,4,216,29,255,94,181,82,227,224,94,126,70,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

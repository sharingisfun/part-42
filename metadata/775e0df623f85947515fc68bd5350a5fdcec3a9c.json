Lily quickly finds herself hunted by well, everyone.\n\nHer only hope is to discover the real traitor before she loses everything--and she'll need Julian's help. That is, if Julian is really there to help her...and not destroy her.\n\nYeah, being a Nephilim isn't everything it's cracked up to be.\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775e0df623f85947515fc68bd5350a5fdcec3a9c","amp;dn":"Unchained+-+J.+Lynn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775e0df623f85947515fc68bd5350a5fdcec3a9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,94,13,246,35,248,89,71,81,95,198,139,213,53,10,95,220,236,58,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Rename them both (for example: &quot;BtCoreIf.old&quot; &quot;BtSdkCE30.old&quot;)\nthen do a soft reset, all better :)\n\nI will only be seeding this for about a day so please download and seed.\n\nAll files needed and a readme is included.\n\nSorry guys, I&amp;#039;m American and I will only be uploading the North America map. I only included one voice, if you want other ones you&amp;#039;ll have to find them yourselves.\n\nThis worked great on my HTC Kaiser\n\nEnjoy, if you like it, buy it and support the developers!\n\n-V\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e478c9e4b8cbb979e51312b420677560b8dd996","amp;dn":"Tomtom+7+Repack+3+with+North_America_720.1803+map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e478c9e4b8cbb979e51312b420677560b8dd996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,71,140,158,75,140,187,151,158,81,49,43,66,6,119,86,11,141,217,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

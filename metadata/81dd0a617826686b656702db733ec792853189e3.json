This required moving x32 and x64 builds into their own folder since the dll name is the same for both 32 and 64 bit versions.\n    - Added support for a cmd.txt file that contains command line parameters. cmd.txt must be in the same folder as the executable.\n    - Added command line parameter /bin that tells the game where the main /bin folder is located relative to the executable. This allows a single bin/WinData folder to be used along side the x32 and x64 versions of the game.\n\n    - Added a new variable to PackageFile resources, Ã¢â‚¬ËœString _preview = Ã¢â‚¬Å“pngOrJpgPathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½;Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This is a square preview image that is used when uploading mods to steam workshop. If not set, no preview image will be uploaded to steam.\n    - Added Steam Workshop support. Mods can be created, updated, downloaded, and browsed in game. Any updates to subscribed mods will download automatically. A reload is required once downloads are complete.\n    - Fixed tooltip text going outside the background boundaries.\n    - Fixed combo boxes not displaying correcly after being enabled, disabled, then re-enabled.

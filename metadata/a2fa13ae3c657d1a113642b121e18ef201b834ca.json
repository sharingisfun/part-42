But this was Johnston's farewell to Doobies Phase 1 -- he needed to fight his personal demons away from the group context -- and this enabled other members of the band to flourish. For once, the piano of Little Feat's Bill Payne gets a lead role. It even opens the album.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Sweet maxine                                         [04:28]\n02.Neal's fandango                                      [03:10]\n03.Texas lullaby                                        [05:03]\n04.Music man                                            [03:34]\n05.Slat key sequel rag                                  [01:53]\n06.Take me in your arms (rock me A little while)        [03:43]\n07.I cheat the hangman                                  [06:38]\n08.PrÃŽËœcis                                               [00:59]\n09.Rainy day crossroad blues                            [03:47]\n10.I been workin' on you                                [04:26]\n11.Double dealin' four flusher                          [03:35]\n________\n41:16 min\n 63,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.

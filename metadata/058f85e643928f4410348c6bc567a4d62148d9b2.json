Here's ours, enjoy.\n\n-\nCo produced by Gorillaz/Damon Albarn and Danger Mouse, &amp;quot;Demon\nDays&amp;quot; was recorded at the band's own Kong Studios. The album is\na darker and more intense affair than 2001's &amp;quot;Gorillaz&amp;quot;. The \ncolours are rich, dark and heavy, while the rhythms are clean,\nstrategic and relentless.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058f85e643928f4410348c6bc567a4d62148d9b2","amp;dn":"Gorillaz-Demon+Days-%28Retail%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058f85e643928f4410348c6bc567a4d62148d9b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,143,133,230,67,146,143,68,16,52,140,107,197,103,164,214,33,72,217,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The writing staff was assembled by the series' head writer, Chiaki J. Konaka.\n\nThe story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top Negotiator. He provides this much needed service with the help of an gynoid named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his butler Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city's history that may hold the key to its future.\n\nThe television series is designed as a tribute to Japanese and Western shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is done in the style of film noir and combines the feel of a detective show with the mecha genre of anime. The setpieces are reminiscent of Toho monster movies and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235357dad95ebf17dded1b4ba0c5e96ec21ef4ee","amp;dn":"The+Big-O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235357dad95ebf17dded1b4ba0c5e96ec21ef4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,83,87,218,217,94,191,23,221,237,27,75,160,197,233,110,194,30,244,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

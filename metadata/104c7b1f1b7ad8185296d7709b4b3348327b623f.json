It was released in October 1969. Five of the six songs are instrumental (the song \\\\\\&quot;Willie the Pimp\\\\\\&quot; features a short vocal by Captain Beefheart). It was Zappa\\\\\\'s first recording project after the dissolution of the original Mothers of Invention. In his original sleeve notes Zappa described the album as \\\\\\&quot;a movie for your ears.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nBecause Hot Rats focuses on instrumental jazz-like compositions with extensive soloing, the music sounds very different from earlier Zappa albums, which featured satirical vocal performances with extensive use of musique concrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨te and editing. Multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood is the only member of the Mothers to appear on the album and was the primary musical collaborator. Other featured musicians were Max Bennett and Shuggie Otis on bass, drummers Aynsley Dunbar and John Guerin and electric violinists Don \\\\\\&quot;Sugarcane\\\\\\&quot; Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty.\n\nThis was the first Frank Zappa album recorded on 16-track equipment and was a relatively early use of the technology. Machines with 16 individual tracks allow for much more flexibility in multi-tracking and overdubbing than the professional 4- and 8-track reel-to-reel tape recorders that were standard in 1969. While Zappa was recording Hot Rats The Beatles were working on their Abbey Road album, but were limited to using 8 track machines.\n\nThe album was dedicated to Zappa\\\\\\'s new-born son, Dweezil Zappa. In February 2009, his band, Zappa Plays Zappa, won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for their rendition of \\\\\\&quot;Peaches en Regalia.\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Frank Zappa. \n\nSide one\n\nNo. \t\n1. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Peaches en Regalia\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \t3:38\n2. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Willie the Pimp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \t9:25\n3. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; 8:58\n\n\nSide two\n\nNo. \t\n4. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Little Umbrellas\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \t3:09\n5. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Gumbo Variations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;  12:55\n6. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;It Must Be a Camel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \t5:15\n\n\nTotal length: 43:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104c7b1f1b7ad8185296d7709b4b3348327b623f","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Hot+Rats+-+%281969%29+-+Artwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104c7b1f1b7ad8185296d7709b4b3348327b623f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,76,123,31,27,122,216,24,82,150,215,112,155,75,51,72,50,123,98,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

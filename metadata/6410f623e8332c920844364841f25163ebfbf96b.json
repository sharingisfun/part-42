Although later albums from Tabor saw her developing a &quot;chamber folk&quot; style to accompany her interpretations of traditional and contemporary songs, her earliest performances were unaccompanied. Her 1976 debut album, AIRS &amp; GRACES, is her least adorned: half the material is performed unaccompanied. &quot;Queen Among the Heather&quot; was learnt from the singing of Belle Stewart, one of her influences. Her version of &quot;Reynardine&quot; is highly regarded and makes for interesting comparison to Fairport Convention's folk-rock version.\n\nThe song that attracted the most attention at the time was &quot;The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; by Scots-born, Australia-based Eric Bogle. This moving account of the Gallipoli landings and their aftermath, as recalled by a crippled soldier, is bursting with barely restrained emotion, and concludes with some softly intoned lines from &quot;Waltzing Matilda.&quot; The rest of the songs are given spare accompaniment by Nic Jones (guitar, fiddle) or Jon Gillaspie (keyboards, woodwind), and range from the traditional &quot;While Gamekeepers Lie Sleeping&quot; to John Tams' account of a departing funfair &quot;Pull Down Lads.&quot;\n\nPersonnel includes: June Tabor (vocals); Nic Jones (guitar, fiddle).\n\nPersonnel: June Tabor (vocals); Nic Jones (guitar, violin); John Gillaspie (keyboards, wind).\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6410f623e8332c920844364841f25163ebfbf96b","amp;dn":"June+Tabor...Airs+and+Graces%281976%29cd%281989%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6410f623e8332c920844364841f25163ebfbf96b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,16,246,35,232,51,44,146,8,68,54,72,65,242,81,99,235,251,249,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She wants to stay in Tokyo in hopes he'll come back to her, but she's miserable: she speaks little Japanese and has a dull job as a law-firm gopher. She stumbles into the neighborhood ramen shop operated by the aging master chef Maezumi and his wife Reiko. His soup cheers Abby, so she decides to apprentice herself to him. He's uninterested, she's insistent, so he shouts at her and gives her all the cleaning to do. Weeks go by; she's persistent. Will he ever actually teach her to cook? And if he does, will she bring the requisite spirit to the job?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f879d093963bfcb6df1ad8c23bfa90e32f05975f","amp;dn":"+The+Ramen+Girl+%282008%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f879d093963bfcb6df1ad8c23bfa90e32f05975f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,121,208,147,150,59,252,182,223,26,216,194,59,250,144,227,47,5,151,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's going to be funny, I promise.\n\nThis is the first of several digital ashcans, or maybe the only one, that will be coming out leading up to the proper launch of the series. We hope you enjoy it, and please share it around to anyone you think would be interested!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8c50ad8eda920dd9afe24316c77c2ab1e190ec","amp;dn":"Panther+Scouts+Ashcan+%231+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8c50ad8eda920dd9afe24316c77c2ab1e190ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,140,80,173,142,218,146,13,217,175,226,67,22,199,124,42,177,225,144,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

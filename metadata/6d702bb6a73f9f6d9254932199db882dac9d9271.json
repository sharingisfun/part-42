And while this may have been compiled with those uninitiated to their other songs in mind, this is also a very nice compilation to have for the dedicated fan who has followed the group religiously. \r\nTheir two biggest hits (&quot;Connected&quot; and &quot;Elevate My Mind&quot;) stand firmly as the crown jewels of the release, but this is definitely not a detractor from the other quality numbers on Retroactive. \r\nIt's a solid guidebook to a band both ahead of its time and sorely overlooked.

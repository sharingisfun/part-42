Enjoying the celebrity and using their skill as con-men, the two adopt their persona to take on the task. Of course, as the two are heterosexual, their interest in the involved ladies intensifies. Ally Walker is a banker, who is distrustful of men and has given up on love. Illeana Douglas plays the dowdy, badly dressed teacher. William H. Macy plays a distrustful sheriff, Ron Perlman is another sheriff, and Paul Dooley is a judge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe88ce81d522e248c761f50c4fe26facbd58329","amp;dn":"Happy%2C+Texas+%281999+HDDVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe88ce81d522e248c761f50c4fe26facbd58329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,232,140,232,29,82,46,36,140,118,31,80,196,254,38,250,203,213,131,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

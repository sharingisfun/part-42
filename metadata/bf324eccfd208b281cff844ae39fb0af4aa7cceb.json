The film opens on 18th century Tokyo where Rikiya has fought a duel over the geisha O-ume. Severely wounded, Rikiya returns home where his sister, Okiku, serves as his nurse. His health restored, he goes to see O-ume only to find her in the arms of the man he thought he had already killed. In the course of a scuffle, the man tosses ashes into Rikiya's eyes, blinding him. Neither he nor his sister can afford a doctor and Rikiya begins to succumb to a fever. Okiku becomes a prostitute to raise money, but she finds herself in trouble after killing a policeman who attempts to rape her. Rikiya, mad from fever, goes to O-ume; shocked out of his madness by once again finding her with another man, he dies. The film ends with Okiku waiting at a crossroads for the dead Rikiya.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Jujiro.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,150,132,224 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:14:10\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x472 (AR: 1.356)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1866 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.258 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019043/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019043/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Silent, with Japanese intertitles\nSubtitles: English and Portuguese\n\nMy rip of a Japanese DVD posted at KG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf324eccfd208b281cff844ae39fb0af4aa7cceb","amp;dn":"Teinosuke+Kinugasa+-+Jujiro+%5BCrossroads%5D+%281928%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf324eccfd208b281cff844ae39fb0af4aa7cceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,50,78,204,253,32,139,40,28,255,132,74,227,159,176,175,74,167,204,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

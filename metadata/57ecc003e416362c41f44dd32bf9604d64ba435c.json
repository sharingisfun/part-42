Here, the police officer is narrator, guiding you through the shift and what happens within it, using his or her own words.\n\nA four-time Emmy nominee, Cops offers a whole new perspective on law enforcement.\n\nEpisode Information\nShow: Cops\nNumber: S26E15\nTitle: Late Night Snacks\nAir Date: 2014-01-18\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ecc003e416362c41f44dd32bf9604d64ba435c","amp;dn":"Cops+S26E15+720p+HDTV+x264-TTVa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ecc003e416362c41f44dd32bf9604d64ba435c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,236,192,3,228,22,54,44,65,244,77,211,43,249,96,77,100,186,67,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

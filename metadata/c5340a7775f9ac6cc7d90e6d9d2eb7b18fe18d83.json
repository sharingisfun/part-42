This is missing only 1 issue which I cannot find anywhere.  Enjoy\n\nGolden Age Origin \nWhen he was 14, Bob Sanders' parents were killed when a tornado hits their hometown of Windy Gap. Bob gets caught up in the tornado and finds that the experience has made him a part of the cyclone itself. Using his strange new powers for the good of mankind, he becomes the Twister. He aided Blue Bolt and Sub-Zero shortly after his debut. The Twister can fly, and one punch from him can send a villain crashing through a wall. Whirling his arms can create a tornado strong enough to carry cars or move them along at super speed. He also carries a Cyclone Gun that shoots powerful bursts of air. Breathing in the wind allows him to manipulate and amplify the wind at will.\n\nGolden Age Appearances \nBlue Bolt Comics Vol 2 #1-7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5340a7775f9ac6cc7d90e6d9d2eb7b18fe18d83","amp;dn":"Twister+Collection+1941+Novelty+Press","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5340a7775f9ac6cc7d90e6d9d2eb7b18fe18d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,52,10,119,117,249,172,108,199,217,14,109,157,46,183,177,143,225,141,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

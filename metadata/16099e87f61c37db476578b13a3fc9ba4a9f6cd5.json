Can an expert spot the difference between cheap and expensive? Meanwhile, Dave Fishwick hits the runway at Bristol Airport to find out what fraction of the price of a plane ticket goes on the cost of a flight, and how much is profit for the airline. He also discovers the best time to get a cheap deal and the most expensive places to buy car fuel in the UK.\r\n\r\n3)  Diamonds and Funerals \r\nDave Fishwick heads to Tel Aviv in Israel to find out if diamonds are as good an investment as they are cracked up to be, while Kate Quilton looks into how much value one of the precious stones loses after it is bought. Kate also investigates the prices of the major funeral directors and discovers how a swimming pool in Redditch is kept warm by the heat from a crematorium, while Dave explores the cost of organising a DIY burial.\r\n\r\n4)  Gas and Perfume \r\nKate Quilton flies to Florence to meet a person whose job is to conjure up new designer scents and looks at the ingredients that go into expensive perfumes - ask if they are really that different to the much cheaper scents in high-street stores. Dave Fishwick heads to Norway to investigate the cost of natural gas and questions if the big companies are giving consumers in the UK a fair deal.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/The-Shoppers-Guide-to-Saving-Money-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3176 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 539 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dtymqr/the-shoppers-guide-to-saving-money","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16099e87f61c37db476578b13a3fc9ba4a9f6cd5","amp;dn":"Ch4+The+Shoppers+Guide+To+Saving+Money+Series+1+4of4+720p+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16099e87f61c37db476578b13a3fc9ba4a9f6cd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,9,158,135,246,28,55,219,71,101,120,177,58,63,201,186,74,159,108,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

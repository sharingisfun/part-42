The world premiere performance of La bohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. Since then, La bohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas internationally. According to Operabase, it is the fourth most frequently performed opera worldwide. In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on Compact Disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.\n\n\n\nLa Boheme (110:18)\nComposer Giacomo Puccini (1858 - 1924)\nConductor Herbert von Karajan\nPerformer Mirella Freni (Soprano - MimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬)\nLuciano Pavarotti (Tenor - Rodolfo)\nElizabeth Harwood (Soprano - Musetta)\nRolando Panerai (Baritone - Marcello)\nGianni Maffeo (Baritone - Schaunard)\nNicolai Ghiaurov (Bass - Colline)\nMichel Senechal (Tenor - Benoit)\nGernot Pietsch (Tenor - Parpignol)\nHans-Dietrich Pohl (Baritone - Customs Officer)\nHans-Dieter Appelt (Bass - Customs Sergeant)\nGenre Opera / Romantic Period\nDate Written 1896\nEnsemble Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra\nPeriod Romantic\nLanguage Italian\nCountry Italy\nRecording Studio\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ace198ac842dac94b842eef5a6bfef66b12beba","amp;dn":"La+Boheme+-+Puccini++%28Karajan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ace198ac842dac94b842eef5a6bfef66b12beba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,206,25,138,200,66,218,201,75,132,46,239,90,107,254,246,107,18,190,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

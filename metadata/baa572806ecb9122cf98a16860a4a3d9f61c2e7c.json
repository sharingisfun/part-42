Qin, the king of the western most province, is under permanent threat of assassination attempts. His greatest fears are the warriors &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, &quot;Flying Snow&quot; and &quot;Sky&quot;. One day one of the magistrates of his kingdom enters the palace, claims that he defeated all three of the emperor's adversaries and tells his story; how he beat &quot;Sky&quot; in a duel and used the love between &quot;Broken Sword&quot; and &quot;Flying Snow&quot; to subdue them.

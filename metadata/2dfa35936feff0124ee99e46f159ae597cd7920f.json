Recreating each performance song by song, Epstein places them within the larger context of Dylan's life, from his meteoric rise as a young folk singer through his reemergence in the 1990s and his role as the ÃƒÂ©minence grise of rock-and-roll today. He explores the star's private side, including marriage and fatherhood, and his struggle to overcome substance abuse. Epstein also traces the influences that shaped Dylan's career and offers a thoughtful analysis of his work and fresh interpretations of his lyrics. Here, too, areand insights from those closest to the man, including D. A. Pennebaker, Allen Ginsberg, Nora Guthrie, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, and Dylan's sidemen throughout the years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dfa35936feff0124ee99e46f159ae597cd7920f","amp;dn":"The+Ballad+of+Bob+Dylan+-+Daniel+Mark+Epstein+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dfa35936feff0124ee99e46f159ae597cd7920f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,250,53,147,111,239,240,18,78,233,158,70,241,89,174,89,124,215,146,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Find out how to choose your best shots, and how to identify what makes one photo better than another similar one. Steve Simon uses examples from his own portfolioâ€”photos shot around the world in locations such as Cuba and India as well as intimate family portraitsâ€”to show how professional photographers select their best images. Plus, get tips on strengthening your final shots with cropping and other post-processing techniques.\r\n \r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b3b4d8fa314f99ec3e836bd617a174a52f29fd","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Photo+Editing+Fundamentals%3A+How+to+Choose+Your+Best+Shot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b3b4d8fa314f99ec3e836bd617a174a52f29fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,179,180,216,250,49,79,153,236,62,131,107,214,23,161,116,165,47,41,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

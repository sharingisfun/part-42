He startled the metal and progressive rock world with the self-titled debut release from his GORDIAN KNOT project. The music explores a wide range of styles from jazz-fusion to metal and it explores them successfully. \n\n&quot;Emergent&quot; includes Bill Bruford on drums and Steve Hackett on guitar, both play prominent roles on the disc. The symbiosis of all musicians involved is probably the most entrancing part of &quot;Emergent&quot;. If you are a guitar player you should definately check this out. This CD smokes &amp; burns with superior musicianship and writing! To fans of technical music, this is a dream list of musicians. \n\n1. Galois (2:05) \n2. Code / Anticode (6:44) \n3.

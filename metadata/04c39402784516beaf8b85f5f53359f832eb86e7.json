With the\n(apparent) help of Denny Laine on some songs, he laid down several demos\nfor a projected new LP project that would reunite him with George Martin.\nAn August 1980 compilation of demos was prepared for George consisting of\nold and new material for consideration for the upcoming LP project.\n\nThe running order of the tape was as follow:\n- Seems Like Old limes\n- Ballroom Dancing\n- Take It Away\n- Turkey And Peacock (perhaps an early version of Peacocks)\n- It\\\\\\'s As Simple As That (Tremolo Cello)\n- Robber Riff\n- We All Stand Together\n- Stiff Tracks (most likely \\\\\\&quot;Boil Crisis\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Give Us A Chord, Roy\\\\\\&quot; which\nwere much like the tunes being released by Stiff Records at the time)\n- Keep Under Cover\n- Average Person\n- The Unbelievable Experience\n- Stop, You Don\\\\\\'t Know Where She Came From\n- Wanderlust\n- Ebony And Ivory\n\nWhile some of the songs (\\\\\\&quot;Ballroom Dancing\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Take It Away\\\\\\&quot;) were particularly\nstrong, some of the tunes Paul submitted (\\\\\\&quot;The Unbelievable Experience\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Boil\nCrisis\\\\\\&quot;) were bad enough to force George to tell Paul to scrap them and write\nmore; this he did. In 1995, excerpts of several tracks were aired on various\nepisodes of \\\\\\&quot;Oobu Joobu\\\\\\&quot;, and although they were in superb quality, all of\nthe airings were incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

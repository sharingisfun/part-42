In order to make something of himself, Dean assumes another identity and manages to enter high society. As he navigates this decadent new world, he meets a host of characters, including David, an older gay man who desires him, and Benjamin, a young hustler from Texas who has also managed to find a place among the aristocracy. Can Dean find love while living a lie? How much is he willing to sacrifice in order to pull off his charade? Presented through three simultaneous frames rather than one. \n\n\n01:46:37\n512x288\n29.97 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e85cd31f1cb815691cec9087c7c80a0678705fa1","amp;dn":"2002+AKA+%28UK%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e85cd31f1cb815691cec9087c7c80a0678705fa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,92,211,31,28,184,21,105,28,236,144,135,199,200,10,6,120,112,95,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

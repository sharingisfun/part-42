Gaarder often writes from the perspective of children, exploring their sense of wonder about the world. He often uses metafiction in his works, writing stories within stories.\n\nSophie Amundsen (Sofie Amundsen in the Norwegian version) is a fourteen year old girl living in Norway in 1990. She lives with her cat Sherekan, her goldfish, a tortoise, two budgerigars and her mother. Her father is a captain of an oil tanker, and is away for most of the year. He does not appear in the book.\n\nSophie's life is rattled as the book begins, when she receives two anonymous messages in her mailbox (Who are you? Where does the world come from?), as well as a post card addressed to 'Hilde MÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸ller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen'. Shortly afterwards she receives a packet of papers, part of a correspondence course in philosophy.\n\nWith these mysterious communications, Sophie becomes the student of a fifty-year-old philosopher, Alberto Knox. He starts out as totally anonymous, but as the story unfolds he reveals more and more about himself. The papers and the packet both turn out to be from him, although the post card is not; it is addressed from someone called Albert Knag, who is a major in a United Nations peacekeeping unit stationed in Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤                                                                                Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ For more information and to discuss this book, please visit us in our group on Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ Facebook.

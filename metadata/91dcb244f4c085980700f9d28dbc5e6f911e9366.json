(We distinguish between demonstrations,\nwhich involve active student participation, and examples, which are\nconducted by the instructor.)\n\nThis book contains more material than could possibly be used in a single\ncourse; we suggest you read through it all and then try out some of the ideas.\nPick and choose what works for you.\n\nPart I of the book presents a large selection of activities for introductory\nstatistics courses. Part II gives some tips on what works and what doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, how\nto set up effective demonstrations and examples, and how to inspire students\nto participate in class and work effectively in homeworks, exams, and group\nprojects. A sample course plan is presented in Chapter 12 to illustrate how to\nintegrate these materials into a semester-long statistics course. Part III presents\ndemonstrations, examples, and projects for some more advanced courses on topics\nincluding decision theory, Bayesian statistics, sampling, and mathematical\nprobability and statistics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91dcb244f4c085980700f9d28dbc5e6f911e9366","amp;dn":"Teaching+Statistics+-+a+bag+of+tricks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91dcb244f4c085980700f9d28dbc5e6f911e9366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,220,178,68,244,192,133,152,7,0,249,210,141,188,94,111,145,30,147,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

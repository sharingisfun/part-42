At once a marijuana smuggler, weed dealer, renegade publisher, political activist, and cosmic prankster, Forcade came of age hot-rodding in his native Arizona, often having occasion to outrace the local police in the famed Bonneville Salt Flats. From his high-octane teenage years until his death in 1978 at age 33, the young outlaw from the wild West always felt most comfortable one step ahead of the law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16361238a647d144cdd1e1177a051659b826304","amp;dn":"High+Times+-+January+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16361238a647d144cdd1e1177a051659b826304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,99,97,35,138,100,125,20,76,221,30,17,119,160,81,101,155,130,99,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

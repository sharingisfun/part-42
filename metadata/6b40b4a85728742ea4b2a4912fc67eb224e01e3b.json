That being said, if there does happen to be a problem with an upload, then fall back to the previous version and NICELY let me know... I'll fix it as soon as I can.\n\n\nPlease DO NOT post comments about new updates. I check daily for updates and if I haven't posted a new version yet, I'll get to it when I get to it. \n\n\nPlease DO NOT make addon requests. The two most popular guides are Zygor and Dugi, and those are the ones that will be uploaded. (I'm working on Dugi currently.)\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 4.0.6164\nReleased on: March 22nd, 2013\n[B] Gear\nAdded in some extra debug information to assist in finding the issue for some incorrect gear suggestions.\nVersion: 4.0.6162\nReleased on: March 22nd, 2013\n[B] Achievements\nAdded and edited content in the current achievements.\n\n[B] Reputations/Dailies\nAdded and edited content in the current dailies.\n\n[A] Reputations\nUpdating reputations in Northrend\nVersion: 4.0.6157\nReleased on: March 22nd, 2013\n[B] Dailies/Reputations\nEdited content for the new 5.2 Isle of Thunder reputations.\nVersion: 4.0.6153\nReleased on: March 21st, 2013\n[B] Achievements\nAdded in achievements for the new Z-Icon system.\nEdited current achievements in our guides.\n\n[B] General\nFixed &quot;Make this your home location&quot; steps that did not have a coordinate or NPC to talk to.\nGeneral housekeeping of includes and tags.\n\n[A] Reputations\nUpdated Northrend Reputations\nVersion: 4.0.6147\nReleased on: March 21st, 2013\nGuide Viewer\nBugfixes for odd errors (login window placement, MagicKey startup)\nVersion: 4.0.6145\nReleased on: March 20th, 2013\n[B] Pets/Mounts\nAdded in the Zandalari raptor battle pets\nGuides have been added for Elder Python, Swamp Croaker, Thundertail Flapper, Living Sandling, and Ji-Kun.\nFixed several parsing errors and issues with the pets and mounts guides\n\n[A] Leveling\nFixed a flight master step in the Leveling guide\n\n[H] Dailies/Reputations\nFixed reported errors with the Sunreaver Onslaught\n\n[A] Dailies/Reputaions\nUpdating repuations in Outland and Northrend\nFixed reported errors with the Kirin Tor Offensive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b40b4a85728742ea4b2a4912fc67eb224e01e3b","amp;dn":"Zygor+Guides+4.0.6164+%28March+22nd%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b40b4a85728742ea4b2a4912fc67eb224e01e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,64,180,168,87,40,116,46,164,178,164,145,47,198,126,178,36,224,30,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

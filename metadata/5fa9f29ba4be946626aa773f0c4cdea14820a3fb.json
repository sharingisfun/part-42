It's no coincidence that the South Carolina singer-songwriter named her dog after Townes Van Zandt Ã¢â‚¬â€ her sound owes a lot to the outlaw country tradition Van Zandt helped define.\n\nSpeaking from a tour stop in Oklahoma City, Hearst says her beloved hound is a vital part of her touring company, which also includes her husband, fellow musician Michael Trent.\n\n&quot;He's our pride and joy, and our best friend, and the person Ã¢â‚¬â€ or dog Ã¢â‚¬â€ that keeps us grounded when we travel,&quot; Hearst tells Weekend Edition guest host David Greene.\n\nHearst got her first taste of fame last year, when one of her songs was used on the HBO series True Blood. &quot;Hell's Bells,&quot; which also appears on her new album, Lions and Lambs, has a dark tone that's well suited to a show about vampires.\n\n&quot;The overall tone of the song is pretty tough and kind of gritty,&quot; she says. &quot;I think that it's also a little subversive. It's been perceived as a drug addict fighting a drunk to see who comes out on top.&quot; She adds, &quot;I think the drug addict comes out on top, 'cause he's meaner.&quot;\n\nIn spite of that bit of national exposure, Hearst says perspective is paramount in her still-nascent career Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially on the road, where there's no telling what kind of crowd she'll draw on a given night.\n\n&quot;Some nights it might be a thousand people, but it might be two people some days,&quot; she says. &quot;You just have to decide at the beginning if you're willing to find happiness without necessarily having a thousand people stroking your ego.&quot;\n\nHaving her husband along for the ride doesn't hurt: &quot;We entertain each other,&quot; she says. And for moral support, the two can turn to Townes, who often settles down to sleep onstage while they're performing.\n\n&quot;He likes to be right in between the bass drum and the loud guitar amp Ã¢â‚¬â€ apparently, those big ears keep out the irritating frequencies,&quot; says Hearst. &quot;I think he quite likes it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa9f29ba4be946626aa773f0c4cdea14820a3fb","amp;dn":"Cary+Ann+Hearst+-+Lions+and+Lambs+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa9f29ba4be946626aa773f0c4cdea14820a3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,169,242,155,164,190,148,102,38,170,119,63,12,76,222,161,72,32,163,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

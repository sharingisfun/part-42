Time warped means the audio is played 38% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\n\nGuests: Dennis McKenna\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36b99d4ad05b2c0cbf18cd353c0c6b266b005ac","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23298+-+Dennis+McKenna+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36b99d4ad05b2c0cbf18cd353c0c6b266b005ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,107,153,212,173,5,178,192,203,241,140,211,83,192,198,178,102,176,5,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

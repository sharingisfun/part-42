The songs all have a shimmering beauty to them that makes this album oddly attractive. \n\nWe'll listen to the Canadian band, Jenson Interceptor and their ultra rare &quot;Pat Benatarish&quot; record, Cosmetics.  \n\nLastly check out Jimmy and the Boys and their 1981 record, Teddy Boys Picnic. Back then this was my introduction to Ignatius Jones and his Aussie new wave band. May I suggest you don't watch their clips on youtube. Meh! Enjoy and seed!\n\nJenson Interceptor - Cosmetics [1983]\n\nJimmy And The Boys - Teddy Boys Picnic [1981]\n\nSwing Set - Life Speeds Up [1986]\n\nThe Lads - Out From The Shadows [1983]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71eb5fa1aafb200c257dc5668c5f40eb10517e7b","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+144%5D+Power+Pop%2C+New+Wave%2C+Indie+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71eb5fa1aafb200c257dc5668c5f40eb10517e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,235,95,161,170,251,32,12,37,125,197,102,140,95,64,235,16,81,126,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

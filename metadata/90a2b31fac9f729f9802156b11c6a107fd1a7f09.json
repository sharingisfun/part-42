This rare album will certainly delight the majority of fans of early Caravan, Traffic and Brian Auger's Trinity (circa 1970) - with dominant and powerful Hammond organ sounds; tight rhythm section and impressive, jazzy guitar licks (somewhat similar to Allan Holdsworth and Robert Fripp). This LP doesn't contain any fillers and certainly belongs to the top of the early 70's French progressive rock. This CD has been carefully remastered (from original source) and sounds deliciously!\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Let It Get Higher 3:41\n02. Summer Song 3:36\n03. Ba'albeck Stone 3:39\n04.

The translation is produced for no commercial gain.\n\nThe Maxim Jakubowski article comes from the afterword to the American edition of The Ties that Bind.\n\nThe photographs are scans from a copy of the ÃƒË†ditions blanche edition.\nThe French edition contains a letter from Vanessa duriÃƒÂ¨s to Franck Spengler. This has not been translated. similarly, Florence Dugas appended a proposed ending to the fifth chapter. This has not been translated either.\n\nMore information about Vanessa DuriÃƒÂ¨s can be found on Wikipedia. Clues to the identity of the Parisian Ã¢â‚¬Å“famous dominatrixÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mentioned by Vanessa in Chapter 4 may be found in a profile of Catherine Robbe-Grillet by Toni Bentley (author of The Surrender) published in Vanity Fair on February 1, 2014.\n\nThe Ties that Bind remains in print in both the original French and english almost twenty years after VanessaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Duri%C3%A8s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Duri%C3%A8s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Duri%C3%A8s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Duri%C3%A8s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ties_That_Bind_%28novel%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ties_That_Bind_%28novel%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a4d123f2a9d9ecfb2d54c37a8638414ff3f8e4","amp;dn":"The+Classmate%2C+Vanessa+Duries+%28for+50+Shades+fans%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a4d123f2a9d9ecfb2d54c37a8638414ff3f8e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,164,209,35,242,169,217,236,251,45,84,195,122,134,56,65,79,243,248,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She treads lightly through a series of disjointed torch songs and smoky pop/rock numbers, singing most of the songs in a soft, gauzy alto, as though shes afraid of waking some sort of slumbering beast. Whenever the tempo picks up, so does Feists desire to keep things weird, with songs like A Commotion pitting pizzicato strings against a half-chanted, half-shouted refrain performed by an army of male singers. But Metals does its best work at a slower speed, where Feist can stretch her vocals across fingerplucked guitar arpeggios and piano chords like cotton. Cicadas and Gulls, with its simple melodies and pastoral ambience, rides the same summer breeze as Iron &amp; Wine, and Anti-Pioneer breaks down the blues into its sparsest parts, retaining little more than a sparse drumbeat and guitar until the second half, where strings briefly swoon into the picture like an Ennio Morricone movie soundtrack. They are gone after 30 seconds, though, leaving things as quiet as they began.  There is a soft-spoken power to Metals, even if its songs are more liquid and atmospheric than the title suggests.\n\nReleased: October 4, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~800 KBps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.

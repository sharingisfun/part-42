Learn how many odysseys The Odyssey contains, and why Hemingway's Nick Adams stories are a pinnacle of twentieth-century literature. From Ovid to Pavese, Xenophon to Dickens, Galileo to Gadda, Calvino covers the classics he has loved most with essays that are fresh, accessible, and wise. Why Read the Classics? firmly establishes Calvino among the rare likes of Nabokov, Borges, and Lawrence--writers whose criticism is as vibrant and unique as their groundbreaking fiction. \n\nFor Italo Calvino, classics are works of enduring cultural value, yes, but also something much more personal: talismans, touchstones, books through which we understand our world and ourselves. In Why Read the Classics?, Calvino shares thirty-six of his classics in essays of warmth, humor, and striking insight. He ranges from Homer to Borges, from the Persian folklorist Nezami to Dickens, and offers surprising insights along the way. Whether tracing the links between OvidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Metamorphoses and Alain Robbe-GrilletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s objectivity, discovering the origins of science fiction in the writings of Cyrano de Bergerac, or convincing us that the Italian novelist Carlo Emilio GaddaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works are like artichokes, Calvino offers a new perspective on beloved favorites and introduces us to hidden gems.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cf317df58a98273eccaadd6d70da26afb76b06","amp;dn":"Why+Read+the+Classics-+Italo+Calvino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cf317df58a98273eccaadd6d70da26afb76b06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,207,49,125,245,138,152,39,62,204,170,221,109,112,218,38,175,183,107,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

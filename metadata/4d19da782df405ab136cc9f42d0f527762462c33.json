Tame by Russell's later standards (Lisztomania), The Music Lovers nevertheless thrives on creative and sexual anguish. Richard Chamberlain plays Tchaikovsky with a bug-eyed intensity as a composer consumed by his art -- so consumed that his romantic attachments become bisexual and irrational. He falls in love with Nina (Glenda Jackson), the hysterical trollop he marries with dire consequences. As he explodes emotionally, his public performance of Piano Concerto in B flat minor becomes a cue for flashbacks to a series of discomforting childhood events that suggest incestuous relations with his sister. Back in real time, Tchaikovsky has to deal with Nina's outbursts while juggling his homosexual urges and his almost hidden desire for Count Anton Chiluvsky (Christopher Gable). The film also details the curious relationship between Tchaikovsky and his rich patroness, the middle-aged widow Madame Nadedja von Meck (Isabella Telezynska), who loves Tchaikovsky deeply, but refuses to meet him -- their only communication being through letters, even though he lives on her estate. Andre Previn and the London Symphony Orchestra perform Tchaikovsky's music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Richard Chamberlain, Glenda Jackson, Max Adrian \r\nDIRECTOR......: Ken Russell\r\nWRITERS.......: Melvyn Bragg\r\nGENRE.........: Biography | Drama | Music\r\nRATING........: 7.2/10  1,670 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066109\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 3mn\r\nSIZE..........: 2.99GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1280x540\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 3170 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English 2.0 AC3+ 224kbps\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSUBTITLES.....: English\r\nSOURCE........: DVD9\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/2b6zronrm/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d19da782df405ab136cc9f42d0f527762462c33","amp;dn":"The.Music.Lovers.1970.720p.DVDRip.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d19da782df405ab136cc9f42d0f527762462c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,25,218,120,45,244,5,171,19,108,201,244,45,15,82,119,98,70,44,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

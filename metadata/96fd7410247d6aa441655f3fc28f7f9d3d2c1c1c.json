The film is based on a story by Luci Ward and Jack Natteford and stars Yvonne De Carlo, Dan Duryea, Jeffrey Lynn, Percy Kilbride and Lloyd Gough.Our overall rating for Black Bart,is: good.\n\nDelightful Western about cheeky outlaw and his romance with exotic dancer, with beautiful costumes and great dialogue. \n\nThe cheerful film is loaded with humorous dialogue. Much of the dialogue is exceptionally funny.\nMaking a movie about a crook is full of pitfalls. It's bad to glamorize crime, but its also dull to preach for two hours. Black Bart avoids these extremes, in part by casting everyone's favorite Bad Boy, Dan Duryea. He is always fascinating as a sly, sneaky and refreshingly comic villain, one whose brashness and insidious schemes are interesting to watch, but never suggested as any sort of role model. \n\nThe real Black Bart,Charles Earl Bowles.\nwas an English-born American Old West outlaw noted for the poetic messages he left behind after two of his robberies. Called Charley by his friends, he was also known as Charles Bolton, C.E. Bolton and Black Bart the Poet.Considered a gentleman bandit, he was one of the most notorious stagecoach robbers to operate in and around Northern California and southern Oregon during the 1870s and 1880s.\nBlack Bart had a reputation for style and sophistication.\n\nBowles left only two authenticated verses. The first was at the scene of the August 3, 1877, holdup on a stage traveling from Point Arena to Duncan's Mills:\n\nI've labored long and hard for bread,\nFor honor, and for riches,\nBut on my corns too long you've tread,\nYou fine-haired sons of bitches.\n\nThe second verse was left at the site of his July 25, 1878, holdup of a stage traveling from Quincy to Oroville. It read:\n\nHere I lay me down to sleep\nTo wait the coming morrow,\nPerhaps success, perhaps defeat,\nAnd everlasting sorrow.\nLet come what will, I'll try it on,\nMy condition can't be worse;\nAnd if there's money in that box\n'Tis munny in my purse.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 909mb\nDuration.... 01:17:19\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1516kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....

And, apart from ancient Italy itself, Roman Britain had the highest density of purpose-built gladiatorial arenas in Europe.\n\nInterest in gladiators has been at an all-time high since Russell Crowe's sword and sandals epic. But the details of the lives and deaths of gladiators remain fragmentary.\n\nNow, featuring sensational new archaeological discoveries, Gladiators: Back from the Dead vividly recreates the world of the Roman arena and how six gladiators lived, fought and died.\n\nThe programme reveals how the various types of gladiator were trained in special schools, including Retiarii, who fought with nets and tridents, heavyweight Myrmillonis sword fighters, Thracians armed with special 'bent' swords, Secutors (literarily pursuers) who wore special helmets, and the Bestiarii, who fought wild animals.\n\nThe programme follows archaeologists and forensic anthropologists as they analyse dozens of Roman skeletons found in Britain over recent years: individuals who evidence shows came from across the Roman Empire.\n\nAnd, using injuries found on the bones, including weapon cut marks and even large carnivore bite marks, as well as evidence of heavy training, the programme re-creates ancient gladiatorial life and death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Ted Marcoux\n=========================\n\n\nProduced by: Jeremy Turner\n==========================\n\n\n\nWritten by: David Keys\n======================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Gladiators Back From The Dead\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:48\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1091 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    349 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667835/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667835/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ***  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s)on\n\nmy older torrents instead,thank you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c78a9798937f9a24c997cae5019f623a644b5b55","amp;dn":"Gladiators+Back+From+The+Dead-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c78a9798937f9a24c997cae5019f623a644b5b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,138,151,152,147,127,154,36,201,151,202,229,1,159,98,58,100,75,91,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

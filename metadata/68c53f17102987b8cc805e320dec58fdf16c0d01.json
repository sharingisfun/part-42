His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically---it's about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he's about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world...and kill him. These two men's lives weave through one of science fiction's most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy, &quot;Stand on Zanzibar &quot;is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of 2010, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.\n\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c53f17102987b8cc805e320dec58fdf16c0d01","amp;dn":"John+Brunner+-+Stand+on+Zanzibar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c53f17102987b8cc805e320dec58fdf16c0d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,197,63,23,16,41,135,184,204,128,94,50,13,236,88,253,241,108,13,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

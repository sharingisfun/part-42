The characters portrayed in this game are individuals able to bend or break the commonly-accepted rules of reality to perform subtle or outlandish acts of magic. These characters are broadly referred to as &quot;mages&quot;. Mage: The Awakening is loosely based on a prior White Wolf product, Mage: The Ascension, which had similar game mechanics, though the terminology differs. While the games both focus on magic, the setting and themes of Mage: The Ascension have been completely replaced.\n\nMage: The Awakening won the 2006 ENnie Award for Best Writing.\n\n(source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Awakening)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b726de4cc441a181dbe062cfa658b9f6c044129","amp;dn":"Mage+the+Awakening+complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b726de4cc441a181dbe062cfa658b9f6c044129","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,114,109,228,204,68,26,24,29,190,6,44,250,101,139,159,108,4,65,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Limited paper sleeve edition. Girl Talk was Tsuyoshi Yamamoto's sixth leader album released by the Three Blind Mice label in a short span of two years. With a huge hit of Midnight Sugar, the young pianist --who was 28 at the time of recording -- had become one of the most popular jazz pianists in Japan. With bluesy and soulful style influenced by Red Garland and Wynton Kelly, Yamamoto and his trio tackled well-known jazz standards and a popular movie tune (&quot;The Way We Were&quot;). One of the highlights is &quot;Take the 'A' Train&quot; which begins with a free style introduction and moves into a high-speed, high-spirited swing.\n\nFollowing the tradition of TBM, the original album was beautifully recorded and received Swing Journal's Best Engineered Jazz Disc Award in 1976. This special Blu-spec CD reissue perfectly transferred the glorious analog sound to digital. A must-have for jazz lovers and audiophiles!\n\nRecorded at Aoi Studio, Tokyo, in December 1975 by Yoshihiko Kannari. Produced by Takeshi Fujii. Blu-spec CD is compatible with all regular CD players. Paper sleeve special limited edition.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - The Way We Were\n02 - Girl Tallk\n03 - Gone With the Wind\n04 - Take the 'A' Train\n05 - I Love You Porgy\n06 - What Now My Love\n07 - Autumn in New York\n\n*2013 Three Blind Mice / Sony Music Japan | THCD-228 {2013 Japan Three Blind Mice Mini LP Blu-spec Remaster}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nTsuyoshi Yamamoto (piano)\nAkira Daiyoshi (bass)\nTetsujiro Obara (drums)\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fd02cb8b2d5f1bfe52f18da05a6fd8220ce106","amp;dn":"Tsuyoshi+Yamamoto+Trio+-+Girl+Talk+%281975%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fd02cb8b2d5f1bfe52f18da05a6fd8220ce106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,253,2,203,139,45,95,27,254,82,241,141,160,90,111,216,34,12,225,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

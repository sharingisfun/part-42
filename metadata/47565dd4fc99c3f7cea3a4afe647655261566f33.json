As a boy growing up in the tiny backwater town of Forty-Five, South Carolina (where everybody is pretty much one beer short of a six-pack), all Mendal Dawes wants is out. \n\nIt's not just his hometown that's hopeless. Mendal's father is just as bad. Embarrassing his son to death nearly every day, Mr. Dawes is a parenting guide's bad example. He buries stuff in the backyardÃ¢â‚¬â€fake toxic barrels, imitation Burma Shave signs (BIRD ON A WIRE, BIRD ON A PERCH, FLY TOWARD HEAVEN, FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH), yardstick collections. He calls Mendal &quot;Fuzznuts&quot; and makes him recite Marx and Durkheim daily and befriend a classmate rumored to have head lice. \n\nMendal Dawes is a boy itching to get out of town, to take the high road and leave the South and his dingbat dad far behindÃ¢â‚¬â€just like those car-chasing dogs.\n\nBut bottom line, this funky, sometimes outrageous, and always very human tale is really about how Mendal discovers that neither he nor the dogs actually want to catch a ride, that the hand that has fed them has a lot more to offer. On the way to watching that light dawn, we also get to watch the Dawes's precarious relationship with a place whose &quot;gene pool [is] so shallow that it wouldn't take a Dr. Scholl's insert to keep one's soles dry.&quot;\n\nTo be consistently funny is a great gift. To be funny and cynical and empathetic all at the same time is George Singleton's special gift, put brilliantly into play in this new collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47565dd4fc99c3f7cea3a4afe647655261566f33","amp;dn":"Why+Dogs+Chase+Cars-+Tales+of+a+Beleaguered+Boyhood+by+George+Si","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47565dd4fc99c3f7cea3a4afe647655261566f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,86,93,212,252,153,195,247,206,163,164,175,230,71,101,82,97,86,111,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

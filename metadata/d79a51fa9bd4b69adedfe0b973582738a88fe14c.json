After all, this is a chart-topping artist who is renowned for her soaring power ballads and can command an impressive Las Vegas performance run. But many listeners are unaware of the French-language aspect of Dion&amp;#039;s career, when, in fact, the emotive vocalist has recorded numerous albums in her native tongue. ON NE CHANGE PAS aims to give this material wider exposure with a well-selected retrospective of music videos and live performance clips for Dion&amp;#039;s Gallic hits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79a51fa9bd4b69adedfe0b973582738a88fe14c","amp;dn":"Celine+Dion+-+On+Ne+Change+Pas+%5B2005%5D%5BDVDRIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79a51fa9bd4b69adedfe0b973582738a88fe14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,154,81,250,155,212,182,154,222,223,224,185,115,88,39,56,168,143,225,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

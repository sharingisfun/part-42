The album was the last to feature the Mellotron, as it would be replaced by the Chamberlin (another device that uses recorded tape to generate sound) on the Moody Blues' next studio album, 1972's Seventh Sojourn.\n\nThis album featured the only track to be written by all five members of the band. The opening &quot;Procession&quot; was a piece that was intended to describe the history of music from the beginning of time up until the album's recording. The only three words heard in this track --&quot;desolation,&quot; &quot;creation,&quot; and &quot;communication&quot; -- were similarly used (along with many other &quot;-ation&quot; words) in &quot;One More Time to Live.&quot;\n\nThe album reached #1 on the UK album charts, in addition to a three week stay at #2 in the U.S., and produced one top-40 single, &quot;The Story In Your Eyes.&quot; The track &quot;Emily's Song&quot; was written by John Lodge for his newborn daughter.\n\nThe title is taken from the student mnemonic for the lines of the treble clef.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7558675a5bf47378264f6d49b6ec94fd384b78cd","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+-+Every+Good+Boy+Deserves+Favour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7558675a5bf47378264f6d49b6ec94fd384b78cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,88,103,90,91,244,115,120,38,79,109,73,182,236,148,253,56,75,120,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

So desperate are her financial straits that Audrey is forced to sell her husband's huge Grantleigh Estate and thus move out of its stately manor house, the manor to which she has become accustomed, and into the humble coach-house in the grounds. To make matters worse, the new owner of the manor is a nouveau-riche businessman, Richard DeVere, a man of distant Czech ancestry whom Audrey views as rather common and vulgar because he made his millions in the wholesale grocery business.\n \n\n\n Accompanying fforbes-Hamilton on her 'downward spiral' is her loyal but decrepit butler Brabinger, and her close friend Marjory Frobisher. Audrey tries to come to terms with her new social standing and the real world of launderettes, buses and supermarkets, but her deeply ingrained feelings of superiority, and her natural tendency to want her own way, cause her many problems. \n\n\n Also along for the ride are Brabinger, Audrey's loyal but decrepit butler and her close friend Marjory Frobisher.\n \n  \n\n\n Cast:\n Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton \n Angela Thorne as Marjory Frobisher \n Keith Barron as Richard DeVere \n Margery Withers as Mrs. Poluvicka\n Nicholas McArdle as Brabinger\n Frank Middlemass as Ned\n \n \n\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E01 - The Rhythms of the Earth\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E02 - The Grapevine\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E03 - What's In A Name\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E04 - Vive le Sport\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E05 - Sons Of The Fathers\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E06 - A Wife's Prerogative\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E07 - The Spare Room\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E08 - An Englishman's Home\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E09 - The Honours List\n To The Manor Born - S01 - E10 - Plenty More Fish\n\n\n\n \n \n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : To The Manor Born.mp3\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFile size                   : 27.4 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 52s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Constant\nTotal bitrate               : 128 Kbps\nAlbum                       : To The Manor Born - Series 01\nAlbum/Performer             : Penelope Keith And Keith Barron\nTrack name                  : To The Manor Born - S01 - E01 - The Rhythms Of The Earth\nTrack position              : 1\nPerformer                   : Penelope Keith And Keith Barron\nGenre                       : Comedy\nRecorded_Date               : 1997\nComment                     : MP3's Recorded By Slimoo\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 56s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 27.4 MB (100%)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb53b7e60de2a426d286a955379a058ccf254a4","amp;dn":"To+The+Manor+Born+-+S01+-+Radio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb53b7e60de2a426d286a955379a058ccf254a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,181,59,126,96,222,42,66,109,40,106,149,83,121,160,88,204,242,84,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Leftwich's delicate vocal oozes over layers of gentle acoustic guitar with smooth female backing vocals bringing another colour to the blend towards the end of the track. The backing vocals, which again feature towards the end of both 'More Than Letters' and the EP's conclusion 'Hole In My Head', sound almost choral, with its harmonised repeated outro to both tracks. The EP continues in a similar vein to its opening track blending Jose Gonzales-like picked acoustic guitars with beautiful echoing vocals and occasional suggestions of percussion.\n\nThere are whiffs of song writing influence of the likes of Ryan Adams, Sigur Ros, Elliot Smith and the aforementioned Death Cab For Cutie and Jose Gonzales throughout; Leftwich has drawn the best of each of his influences into his own style. 'A Million Miles Out' is a beautiful, thoughtful and gentle EP leaving high expectation for Benjamin Francis Leftwich's 2011 full length follow up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c49a11af13fc86d18c841c720a893e7a643a901","amp;dn":"A+Million+Miles+Out+EP+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c49a11af13fc86d18c841c720a893e7a643a901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,73,161,26,241,63,200,109,24,200,65,199,32,168,147,231,166,67,169,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

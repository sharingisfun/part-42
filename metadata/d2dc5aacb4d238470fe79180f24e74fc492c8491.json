They are hard men, loners for whom the Company provides the necessities: beds, food, drink and women for hire. Now, in apparent suicide or in frenzied madness, the men are dying...\r\n\r\nTo OUTLAND comes the new U.S. Marshall O'Neil, a man with a sense of duty so strong it drives him to ferret out evil, greed and murder regardless of the cost. If he must, he will forfeit love, livelihood -- even life itself. \r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction\r\n\r\nPrint Edition: 269 Pages, ISBN: 0446958298 (ISBN13: 9780446958295)\r\n \nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35190.Outland?from_search=true\r\n\r\nIf this ebook file is not compatible with your device, Calibre is a free, open source ebook management program which can convert between multiple formats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2dc5aacb4d238470fe79180f24e74fc492c8491","amp;dn":"Outland+-+Alan+Dean+Foster+%28ePUB+eBook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2dc5aacb4d238470fe79180f24e74fc492c8491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,220,90,172,180,210,56,71,15,231,145,128,242,78,116,252,73,44,132,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

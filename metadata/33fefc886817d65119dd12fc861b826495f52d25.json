Weisberg puts everything on the line to achieve the seemingly impossible: reuniting the 10 members of the Grammy-winning Wu-Tang Clan including Method Man (\\\\\\&quot;Garden State\\\\\\&quot; TV\\\\\\&amp;#039;s \\\\\\&quot;The Wire\\\\\\&quot;) RZA (composer for \\\\\\&quot;Blade: Trinity\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Kill Bill\\\\\\&quot; vols. 1 and 2) and founding member the late Ol\\\\\\&amp;#039; Dirty Bastard to perform at the 2004 \\\\\\&quot;Rock the Bells\\\\\\&quot; hip-hop concert. As if each Wu-Tang member is not difficult enough to work with the venue\\\\\\&amp;#039;s incompetent security malfunctioning equipment and riotous crowd all work in tandem to try keeping the history making show from going on. But Weisberg and his team come through to deliver a concert and a Wu-Tang Clan performance of a lifetime!

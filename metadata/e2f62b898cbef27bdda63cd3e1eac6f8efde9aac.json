Offering an incendiary Thrash Metal dotted with old-school and new school element, these guys are ready to kick some asses.\n\nWith their first album ''Thrashin' The NeighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ on Galy Records in 2007 the group established venomous stage appearances, which left no fan indifferent. Touring Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, they finally came up with their first full length album called ''Ignorance Is No Excuse'' in 2009, which will let them perform next to bands like Municipal Waste, Exodus, Martyr, Quo Vadis, Cauldron, Aggressor, Brutal Truth, Macabre, Neuraxis, Augury, Soothsayer, Cryptopsy etc.. After nearly an hundred shows, the band split in 2011... to finally come back in force in 2013 with a new line-up and a new EP entitled ''Great Balls''. That new formation is now formed by Patrick Martin (vocals) and Francis Labelle (drums), both original members of the band. With the addition of the frenetic playing of Fred Bizier on bass and the furious energy of Joel Racine and Ludovic Bastien shredding the guitars, Reanimator became stronger than ever and are already writing the next full-length album ... In the meantime, join us at a show in your city and get ready for a real Thrash NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll atmosphere!\n\n\nYear: 2015\nCountry: Canada\nGenre: Thrash Metal \nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 320Kbps\nSize: 82.95 MB\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01.

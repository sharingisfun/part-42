Directed by Bryan Singer, it is the seventh installment of the X-Men film series and acts as a sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. The story, inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; produced by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods and Wolverine going to 1973 to save the future of mankind. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hoult, Shawn Ashmore, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay from a story conceived by him, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman.\n\nThe film is a British-American co-production with a budget of US$200 million. Principal photography began in Montreal, Quebec in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and pick-ups taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. The film premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past received critical acclaim, becoming the best-reviewed film in the X-Men series. Reviewers commended its fresh visual style, story, and acting. It is also the highest-grossing film in the series, having earned over $746 million worldwide. A sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse, is scheduled for release on May 27, 2016, with Singer returning to direct.\n\nPlot\nIn the future, robots known as Sentinels are exterminating all mutants, as well as any humans who seek to help them. A band of mutants evades the Sentinels with the help of Kitty Pryde, who can project a person's consciousness into the past. Pryde's group convenes with Storm, Wolverine, Professor Xavier, and Magneto at a monastery in China. Pryde sends Wolverine's consciousness to 1973 to prevent Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels. Following the assassination, Mystique was captured, and her DNA was used by Trask's company to create Sentinels, whose ability to adapt to any mutant power makes them almost invincible. Xavier and Magneto advise Wolverine to find both of their younger selves for help.\n\nWolverine awakens in 1973. At the X-Mansion, he encounters Xavier and Beast. Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters has closed after most of the teachers and students were drafted for the Vietnam War. Xavier, now a broken man, is overusing a serum which allows him to walk and suppresses his telepathy. Wolverine explains his mission and persuades Xavier to help free Magneto from a prison cell beneath the Pentagon, where he is being held for allegedly assassinating President John F. Kennedy. They rescue Magneto with the help of Peter Maximoff, a mutant with superhuman speed.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Trask unsuccessfully lobbies Congress to gain support for his Sentinel program. Meanwhile, in Saigon, Mystique prevents William Stryker from appropriating a group of mutant G.I.s for Trask's research. Mystique investigates Trask's office and discovers he has been capturing mutants to use in experiments. Xavier, Magneto, Beast, and Wolverine fly to Paris to intercept Mystique. In Paris, Mystique impersonates a South Vietnamese general to infiltrate the Paris Peace Accords with Trask, who is trying to sell his Sentinel technology to communist nations. Xavier, Magneto, Beast, and Wolverine arrive as Mystique is about to kill Trask. Magneto tries to kill Mystique to ensure her DNA cannot be used for the Sentinels, but she jumps from a window. The fight spills onto the street in view of the public, allowing Magneto and Mystique to escape. During this time in the future, Pryde's control over Logan weakens, and he injures Pryde.\n\nTrask is saved, but the world is horrified by the existence of mutants. President Richard Nixon approves Trask's Sentinel program and arranges an unveiling ceremony. Trask's scientists recover Mystique's blood from the street. Meanwhile, MagnetoÃ¢â‚¬â€who has recovered his telepathy-blocking helmetÃ¢â‚¬â€intercepts the prototype Sentinels in transit and laces their polymer-based frames with steel, allowing him to control them. At the mansion, Xavier stops taking his serum and slowly regains his mental powers, while losing the ability to walk. Through Wolverine, Xavier speaks to his future self and is inspired to work for peace between humans and mutants once again. He uses Cerebro to track Mystique, who is heading to Washington D.C.\n\nAs Xavier, Wolverine, and Beast search for Mystique, Nixon unveils the Sentinel prototypes at the White House. Magneto commandeers the Sentinels and attacks the crowd, then sets the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium around the White House as a barricade. Nixon and Trask, accompanied by the Cabinet, Secret Service officers, and Mystique (disguised as a Secret Service member), are taken to a safe room. Wolverine and Beast try to stop Magneto, but he pits a Sentinel against them and then throws Wolverine into the Potomac River. In the future, the X-Men make their final stand as a large army of Sentinels attack the monastery. In 1973, Magneto pulls the safe room from the White House and prepares to kill Nixon and his Cabinet. Mystique, disguised as Nixon, incapacitates Magneto with a plastic gun. Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask and allows her and Magneto to flee. Mystique's actions are seen as a mutant saving the President, leading to the cancellation of the Sentinel program. Trask is arrested for trying to sell American military secrets.\n\nWolverine wakes up in the future to find Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, Pryde, Beast, Storm, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Xavier alive. In 1973, Mystique impersonates Stryker and takes custody of Wolverine.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a crowd chants to En Sabah Nur, who is using telekinesis to build pyramids as four horsemen keep watch nearby.\n\n\nVideo:\n\nSource - BluRay Disc\n\nCodec - h264\n\nFile Type - m4v\n\nFile Size - 817 mb\n\nLength - 02:11:36\n\nFrame Width - 1280\n\nFrame Height - 534\n\nData Rate - 772 kbps\n\nTotal Bitrate - 868 kbps\n\nFrame Rate - 23 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nCodec - mp3\n\nBit Rate - 96 kbps\n\nChannels - 2(stereo)\n\nAudio Sample Rate - 44 khz\n\n[img]http://i1371.photobucket.com/albums/ag285/HeAdCnA/XMenDaysOfFuturePast2014720pBRRipH264-HeAdCnAavi_thumbs_20141008_065235_zps4ee9372e.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e4fe8bd168bfd6fd85b46bf4efe6befc5fd65ca","amp;dn":"X+Men+Days+Of+Future+Past+2014+720p+BRRip+H264+-+HeAdCnA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e4fe8bd168bfd6fd85b46bf4efe6befc5fd65ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,79,232,189,22,139,253,111,216,91,70,191,78,254,107,239,197,253,101,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Her work here documents an intense 18-month observation, from January 1990 to June 1991, of a single family unit. Moss escorted cinematographer Colbeck as he filmed a documentary, airing on PBS's &quot;Nature&quot; program this month. Moss's charming writing makes for understandable science. Her text reads like a novel yet is scientifically accurate, unexaggerated, and highly informative.\nReaders will become involved with matriarch Echo and her family, kin, and clan. Librarians should have handy Moss's previous work, Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family ( LJ 2/15/88), as there is likely to be interest in it as well. Strongly recommended for all public libraries and elephant/Africa collections.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgements 6\nFOREWORD by Sir David Attenborough 9\nINTRODUCTION l3\nBETWEEN THE RAINS January to earll Marcb 1990 35\nTHE RAINY SEASON Marcb to Mal 1990 77\nTHE DRY SEASON June to early November 1990 100\nDROUGHT November 1990 to Marcb 1991 134\nTHE LONG RAINS Late March to June 1991 159\nIndex 190","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d04a8354ae4c7d6fbc3a68fce8bf507c963fe5","amp;dn":"Echo+of+the+Elephants+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d04a8354ae4c7d6fbc3a68fce8bf507c963fe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,208,74,131,84,174,76,125,111,188,58,104,252,232,191,80,124,150,63,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

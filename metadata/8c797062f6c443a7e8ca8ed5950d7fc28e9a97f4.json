It argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe, and that the Big Bang is a consequence of the laws of physics alone. \n\nThe authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory may not exist. Albert Einstein and other physicists had proposed such a theory based on an early model of the universe containing three-dimensions and time. Since then, significantly changed models of the universe have been suggested. Many physicists now believe that the universe has 10, or even 11 (M-Theory) dimensions.\n\nReleased: 2010\nGenre: Audiobook\nQuality: ~128kbps mp3\n\nTracks:\n\n 1. CD1 - 1:07:11\n 2.

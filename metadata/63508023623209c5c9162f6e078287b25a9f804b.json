Also its about getting a laugh or two but mainly its service is to entertain through tits.\n\nSpread it around as much as possible, upload it anywhere you can and send the link in this forum. Gotta keep with SWAP.avi\\\\\\'s legacy and spread everywhere.\n*Warning, does not contain corn*\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiteral description...\n\nAMV.avi is a clip show of many types of Hentai Anime\\\\\\'s brought together as a series of short music videos. (AMV\\\\\\'s)\n\nThe movie was created to honor the far superior AMV Hell 0 as well as the meme \\\\\\&quot;SWAP.avi\\\\\\&quot; Google it if you don\\\\\\'t know but that movie is...well think 2 girls 1 cup but an actual full length film. Really.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video and if there is an issue with the torrent copy you can always use one of the versions below\n\nStreaming version:\n\nDirect download: http://www.mirrorcreator.com/files/2KC1NZMN/AMV.avi_(MP4)_0.mp4_links\n\niPod Touch/iPhone ready version: http://www.mirrorcreator.com/files/1JP2IX84/AMV.avi_fuze.avi_link\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nCredits\n \n*In the movies credits like three or so of them are messed up so this list is the fixed version in order of appearance.

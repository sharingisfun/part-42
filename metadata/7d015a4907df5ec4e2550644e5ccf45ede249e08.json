What was supposed to be a musical melting pot - with funk, Southern rock, country, and neo-psychedelia all mixed in.  The guys hit the reset button on Circuital, which sounds like Evil Urges older, wiser brother. This isnt a conventional rock album by any means, and My Morning Jacket rarely waste an opportunity to dive down the creative rabbit hole and see what exists on the other side. 70s rock epics, trippy pop waltzes, piano ballads, Motown metal fusions, and orchestral folk songs are what they come up with, and the album rarely explores the same sound twice, bouncing between amalgamated genres with purpose and a sly grin. \n\nTracks: \n\n1.

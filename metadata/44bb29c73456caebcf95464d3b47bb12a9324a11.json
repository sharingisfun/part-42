Each victory grants players an upgraded, unique sword, providing them the type of blade they need to successfully defeat the next in line of opponents. Once they've cut their way through the list of historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top masters, they must defeat the mysterious final combatant in order to earn the title of Greatest Swordsman of All Time. Beginning humbly in the dojo, players train and prepare with their sensei before setting off to battle. Players gain the skills and combos necessary during these rigorous training sessions by tackling a series of drills including carving, sparring, blocking and even battling a horde of zombies! In addition, players can train together with a friend or go head to head in the arena to determine the ultimate master of the blade.        \n\n\nNOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.\n\nTo install &amp; play off disc:\n1.

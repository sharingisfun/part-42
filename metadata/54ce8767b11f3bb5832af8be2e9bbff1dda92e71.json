Compelled to pose as husband and wife, they are forced into a strange intimacy. Terrified of discovery, the couple are wary of all those around them, and even of each other. As their individual loyalties are challenged, their relationship begins to change - calling into question the emotional certainties of their normal lives, and forcing them to re-assess who they really trust.\n\nContainer:  \tAVI\nRuntime: \t1h 41mn\nSize: \t1.31 GiB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ce8767b11f3bb5832af8be2e9bbff1dda92e71","amp;dn":"Bizalom+aka+Confidence+%281980%29.+Istvan+Szabo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ce8767b11f3bb5832af8be2e9bbff1dda92e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,206,135,103,177,31,59,181,131,42,248,190,46,155,191,241,221,169,46,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

He can't afford a big attorney, so he hires shrewd Ken Bowden (Bill Murray), while Kelly's mom, Sandra Van Ryan (Theresa Russell), Sam's former lover, gets a platoon of top lawyers. Trailer-trash Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) backs up Kelly's claim and additional plot twists and turns develop. The seldom-seen Carrie Snodgrass (Diary of a Mad Housewife) has a supporting role in this film. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 48 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f37b71d7dbb4df7b67e39ea99d314b7fcd21d7c","amp;dn":"Wild+Things%281998%29DVDRIp.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f37b71d7dbb4df7b67e39ea99d314b7fcd21d7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,55,183,29,125,187,77,247,182,126,57,234,153,211,20,183,252,210,29,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

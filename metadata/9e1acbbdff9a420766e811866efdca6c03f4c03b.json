He played piano and trombone with Bobby Mitchell &amp; the Toppers from 1952 to 1955 before catching on with saxist Eddie Smith's band. Henry improvised the basic idea behind &quot;Ain't Got No Home&quot; on the bandstand one morning in the wee hours; when the crowd responded favourably, he honed it into something unique. Paul Gayten (New Orleans A&amp;R man for Chess Records) concurred, hustling Henry into Cosimo Matassa's studio in September of 1956. Local DJ Poppa Stoppa laid the &quot;Frogman&quot; handle on the youngster when he spun the 45 (issued on the Chess subsidiary Argo), and it stuck.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Got No Home 2:21\n2 I Told My Pillow 2:18\n3 Same Old Way 3:13\n4 TainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t It The Truth 4:00\n5 Easy 6:47\n6 Nothing from Nothing 2:37\n7 For Your Love 3:20\n8 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Been Around 3:07\n9  Kansas City 2:21\n10 Basin Street 3:37\n\nPersonnel:\n\nClarence Henry vocals, piano\nAl Bemiss  keyboard\nWarren Nabonne bass\nSteve Hughes guitar\nBernard Johnson drums\nMicheal Pearce tenor\nCarl Blouin baritone\nJoseph Smith Jr trumpet\nArthur McLin trumpet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e1acbbdff9a420766e811866efdca6c03f4c03b","amp;dn":"Clarence+Frogman+Henry+Bourbon+St+New+Orleans%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e1acbbdff9a420766e811866efdca6c03f4c03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,26,203,189,255,154,66,7,102,232,17,134,110,253,202,108,3,244,192,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

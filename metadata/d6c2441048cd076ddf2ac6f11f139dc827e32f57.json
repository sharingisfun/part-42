On a luminous spring day in Venice, Commissario Brunetti and his assistant Vianello play hooky from the Questura in order to help Vianello's friend Marco Ribetti, arrested during an environmental protest. They secure his release, only to be faced by the fury of the man's father-in-law, Giovanni De Cal, a cantankerous glass factory owner who has been heard in the bars of Murano making violent threats about Ribetti. Brunetti's curiosity is piqued, and he finds himself drawn to Murano to investigate. Is De Cal the type of man to carry out his threats? Then one morning the body of De Cal's night watchman is found. Over long lunches, on secret boat rides, in quiet bars, and down narrow streets, Brunetti searches for the killer. Will he unravel the clues before the night watchman's death is allowed to be forgotten?\nThere is a version of this novel on Demonoid read by the American David Colacci as well as an abridged version read by Andrew Sachs.\n\nUnabridged \n9 hours duration. 8 CD's\nRead by the Gordon Griffin.\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c2441048cd076ddf2ac6f11f139dc827e32f57","amp;dn":"Through+a+Glass+Darkly+-++Donna+Leon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c2441048cd076ddf2ac6f11f139dc827e32f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,194,68,16,72,205,7,109,223,42,198,241,31,19,157,200,39,227,47,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

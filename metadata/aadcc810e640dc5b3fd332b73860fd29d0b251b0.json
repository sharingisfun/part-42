Since 2009, Lustig's LAST KISS has been a web comic on GoComics.com/lastkiss.\n\nBefore comics ruined his brain, Lustig was a reporter - covering everything from mass murders to school lunch menus. (Thankfully, never in the same article.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aadcc810e640dc5b3fd332b73860fd29d0b251b0","amp;dn":"LAST+KISS+-+CASUAL+FRIDAYS+and+2+more+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28K6-Empir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aadcc810e640dc5b3fd332b73860fd29d0b251b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,220,200,16,230,64,220,91,63,211,50,183,56,96,253,41,208,178,81,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

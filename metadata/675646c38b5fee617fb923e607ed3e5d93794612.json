Playing acoustic guitar and piano and performing solo, with minimal backing, and with a full band (not to mention a trio of magicians and an impressive stage set), Stevens runs through some 20 songs, drawing from his entire catalog, with particular emphasis on Tea for the Tillerman. The remastered digital sound is excellent.&quot; (Amazon)\n\nA must watch for any Cat Stevens fan!! Still one of my favorite musicians today.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nJediMaster\n\n\n(concert only)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:675646c38b5fee617fb923e607ed3e5d93794612","amp;dn":"Cat+Stevens+Majikat+Concert+480p+JediMaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"675646c38b5fee617fb923e607ed3e5d93794612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,86,70,195,139,95,238,97,127,185,35,230,7,237,62,93,147,121,70,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

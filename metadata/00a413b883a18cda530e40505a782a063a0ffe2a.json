It is most noted for it's funk-style guitar parts that permeate throughout the entire song.\n\nAlthough the song did not reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it peaked at #8 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US and, in a heavily remixed form with re-recorded vocals and less of a rock influence, was the band's biggest hit single in the UK, peaking at #12 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA song with the same title is released by Tim Christensen on his album &quot;Superior&quot; in 2008.\n\nTime's Up is the second album by Living Colour, released on August 20, 1990. It was the follow-up to the successful Vivid. The album features a wide range of genres and also includes cameo appearances by Queen Latifah, Little Richard, Doug E. Fresh, Maceo Parker and James Earl Jones. After the album was released, it reached gold status, peaked at #13 on the Billboard 200 and later won a Grammy for best hard rock album of the year. It is the last album to feature Muzz Skillings on bass. As of 2009, the CD is out of print, but the album is available as an MP3 download.\n\nLiving Colour is an American funk metal band from New York, formed in 1984.  Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by free jazz, funk, and hard rock. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking Eurocentrism and racism in America. The band were prominent members of the Black Rock Coalition during the late 1980s and early 1990s (a movement which also featured Fishbone, and 24-7 Spyz).\n\nLiving Colour rose to fame with their debut album Vivid in 1988. Although the band scored a number of hits, they are best remembered for their signature song &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1989, and their highest charting single &quot;Type&quot;. They were also named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. After disbanding in 1995, Living Colour reunited in late 2000.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a413b883a18cda530e40505a782a063a0ffe2a","amp;dn":"Living+Colour+-+Love+Rears+It%5C%27s+Ugly+Head+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a413b883a18cda530e40505a782a063a0ffe2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,164,19,184,131,161,140,218,83,14,64,80,90,120,42,6,58,15,254,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

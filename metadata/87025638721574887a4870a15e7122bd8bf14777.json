ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all in the magic paste, says Rick, as he takes us to the Merida market to explore the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s colorful, aromatic essential seasoning pastes (or recados). These magical mounds of spice blends become the base for grilling rubs, the heart and soul of tamales, the seasoning for all kinds of food wrapped in banana leaves and the flavoring undercurrent for tangy escabeches and slow-simmered stews. We journey from an achiote tree to the commercial grinders for the seeds to RickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home to understand this aromatic, alluring spice so beloved in the Yucatan. Rick shows us how to make our own Achiote Seasoning Paste, and then use it for Short Ribs Kabik. Then we make the garlicky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBistecÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Seasoning Paste to use in the stunning dish of Grilled Chicken in Escabeche. The journey ends in ManÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ for a bowl of pavo en relleno negro, a local specialty of turkey and stuffing flavored with the exotic jet-black paste of charred chiles.

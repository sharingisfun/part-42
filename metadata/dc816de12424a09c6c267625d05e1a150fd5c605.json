This is a non-horror production, it is based on the de Maupassant stories Boule de Suif (which also inspired Stagecoach) and Mademoiselle Fifi. The title does not refer to Simone's character, it refers to the sadistic Prussian officer (Kurt Krueger) who has a somewhat feminine appearance and mannerism; apparently Klaus Barbie was like this in real life.\n\nThe setting is the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, obviously Wise and Co. were thinking of WWII. The censorship of the time prevented the story from being told properly, a remake would be a good idea.\n\nDespite this,it has good acting and is worth seeing, if only as one of Robert Wise's earliest pictures.\n\nRipped from tape. In VOB format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc816de12424a09c6c267625d05e1a150fd5c605","amp;dn":"Mademoiselle+Fifi+%281944%29+Val+Lewton+Simon+Simone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc816de12424a09c6c267625d05e1a150fd5c605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,129,109,225,36,36,160,156,108,38,118,37,208,94,26,21,15,213,198,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

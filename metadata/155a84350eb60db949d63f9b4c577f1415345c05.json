Plays a man with the reputation as a fast gun.  He wants to leave that life behind, so he puts away the gun and comes to new town unarmed.  Become known for not going armed.  Eventually he must decide between protecting the town and his desire for non-violence.\n\nBlack and white film.  Great acting, great story.  No subs.  English only. Avi format, one file.  Excellent quality.\n\nMore classic sci-fi and westerns coming. Got to love the old stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155a84350eb60db949d63f9b4c577f1415345c05","amp;dn":"Glenn+Ford+-+The+Fastest+Gun+Alive+%281956%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155a84350eb60db949d63f9b4c577f1415345c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,90,132,53,14,182,13,185,73,214,63,155,76,87,127,20,21,52,92,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

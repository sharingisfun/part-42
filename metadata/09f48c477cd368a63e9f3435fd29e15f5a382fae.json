His life and career were marked by a stunning rise to power, scandal, and tragedy. He had one of the most notorious love affairs of any public figure in American history, and met his death in a startling act of political violence -- the famous duel with Aaron Burr. But his contributions as a statesman survive. As first Secretary of the Treasury during the tumultuous early years of the republic, Hamilton led the transformation of the young country into a commercial and industrial powerhouse. He was the one founder who had a vision, not of what America was, but of what it could become. This two-hour AMERICAN EXPERIENCE tells the story of the underappreciated genius who laid the groundwork for the nation's modern economy - including the banking system, Wall Street, and an &quot;opportunity society&quot; in which talent and hard work, not birth, determined success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f48c477cd368a63e9f3435fd29e15f5a382fae","amp;dn":"American+Experience+-+Alexander+Hamilton+%28PBS%29+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f48c477cd368a63e9f3435fd29e15f5a382fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,244,140,71,124,211,104,166,62,159,52,53,253,41,225,95,90,56,47,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

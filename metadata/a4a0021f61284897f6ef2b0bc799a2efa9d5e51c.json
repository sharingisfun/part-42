Bits of the each show's Soundchecks are included at the end of both shows.\n\nThe new box set was fully remixed from the band's multitrack masters and mastered for release. July 30, 1997 was Phish's first Ventura stop since Trey learned to surf nearby in 1993. The show featured a number of must-hear performances including a bass-driven, syncopated &quot;Wolfman's Brother&quot; &gt; &quot;Chalk Dust Torture&quot;, a deep and spacey &quot;Stash&quot; and &quot;Character Zero&quot; in Set I. A &quot;Free&quot; &gt; &quot;David Bowie&quot; &gt; &quot;Cities&quot; &gt; &quot;David Bowie&quot; combination dominated the show's second half with some of the summer's biggest jams.\n\nOn July 20, 1998 Phish again encountered Ventura's breezy oceanside. Ventura '98 was characterized by some new songs and some bustouts. The first set included a &quot;Bathtub Gin&quot; opener, a new arrangement of &quot;Water In The Sky&quot;, the swinging funk of &quot;The Moma Dance&quot; and a &quot;Split Open And Melt&quot; Set I closer. Set II exploded with a bass-and-drums-fueled &quot;Drowned&quot; &gt; &quot;Makisupa Policeman&quot; pairing that utilized Page's synth stylings to seamlessly blend rock and reggae. &quot;Maze&quot; led to a perfectly placed &quot;Sea And Sand&quot;.\n\n&quot;Ventura&quot; Box Set Tracklisting\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.

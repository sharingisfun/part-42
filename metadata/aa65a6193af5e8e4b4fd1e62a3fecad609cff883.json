In each chapter, you will learn programming concepts and apply them immediately as you build an application or enhance one from a previous chapter. These applications have been carefully designed and tested to teach the associated concepts and to provide practice working with the standard development tools Xcode, Interface Builder, and Instruments. The guideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learn-while-doing approach delivers the practical knowledge and experience you need to design and build real-world applications. Here are some of the topics covered:\nDynamic interfaces with animation\nUsing the camera and photo library\nUser location and mapping services\nAccessing accelerometer data\nHandling multi-touch gestures\nNavigation and tabbed applications\nTables and creating custom rows\nMultiple ways of storing and loading data: archiving, Core Data, SQLite\nCommunicating with web services\nALocalization/Internationalization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa65a6193af5e8e4b4fd1e62a3fecad609cff883","amp;dn":"iPhone+Programming+-+The+Big+Nerd+Ranch+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa65a6193af5e8e4b4fd1e62a3fecad609cff883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,101,166,25,58,245,232,228,180,253,30,98,163,254,202,214,9,207,248,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

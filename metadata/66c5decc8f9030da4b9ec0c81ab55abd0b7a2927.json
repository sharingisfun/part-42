To me her later works are more techno/disco/eurotrashy.....\n\nI originally uploaded a torrent of this in mp3 format, which was good, but this is far better.\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project! Since all TQMP torrents are tracked by countless other trackers by now, the lifetime of your uploads will increase by a BIG margin ;)\n\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless FLAC format AND include artwork. Include .cue, .m3u and logfiles in the torrent and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)\n\nYou can find all TQMP uploads at: www.thepiratebay.se/tag/tqmp\n\n\nTrack List:\n\nSnow On The Sahara\nOver Their Walls\nOn The Breath of an Angel\nA Rose in the Wind\nMy Sensual Mind\nValparaiso\nSelamanya\nBy The Moon\nDream of Me\nSecret of the Sea\nLife On Mars\n\nAnother fine musical experience, brought to you by the ShadowMastr!\n\nEnjoy, comment, AND SEEEEEEDDD!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c5decc8f9030da4b9ec0c81ab55abd0b7a2927","amp;dn":"Anggun+-+Snow+On+The+Sahara+1997+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c5decc8f9030da4b9ec0c81ab55abd0b7a2927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,197,222,204,143,144,48,218,75,158,192,200,26,181,90,189,11,122,41,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

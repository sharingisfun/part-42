Inspired by the slashing delta blues of Charley Patton and Son House, the sparkling ragtime of Blind Blake and the powerful songster traditions of Leadbelly, Sugarcane sings passionately with a voice that is big and soulful, writes songs that are potent and rich with imagery and attacks the guitar with a driving rhythmic swing. He cut his blues teeth in rough canefield pubs and the dangerous waterfront bars of CairnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ famed and feared but now gone Barbary Coast and his 25 year performing career in far north Queensland is the stuff of local legend.\nThis stunning album from Sugarcane Collins is a dark and vivid collection of thirteen songs plumbed from deep within the rhythms of life in the mississippi delta of the 1920ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &amp; 30ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. With sparse arrangements, brooding production and the inspired musicianship of all involved, Sugarcane conjures up the cotton fields and baptist churches, the stale-beer smoke-choked juke joints and gutbuckets, the freight trains, prison cells and street corners of the south that gave birth to the blues. Everything about this album is remarkable. This is a masterpiece album from Australian bluesman. Simply - beautiful music!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c707c2b9cf6c6dc1a89ca7b4005ce9a2905e8184","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Sugarcane+Collins+-+Way+Down+The+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c707c2b9cf6c6dc1a89ca7b4005ce9a2905e8184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,7,194,185,207,108,109,193,168,156,167,180,0,92,233,162,144,94,129,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's old, it's dated, and probably buggy as hell (I play on PS2). Still my favorite game.\n\nThis game is not my rip/burn/crack/whatever. I found it on the net after a lot of searching, and I just wanted it available to whoever wanted to experience this great game in it's original form. So if you have a problem, it's not my fault. Enjoy.\n\nFile is served .rar at 400mb, extracts to 900MB. No install needed, just go into the &quot;System&quot; folder and click on &quot;DeusEX&quot;. If you want to update the version or hack/mod the game, you'll have to Google for it. I'm done here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a180da4e56feaee9f4cdcf63d79191a9ac71613","amp;dn":"Deus+Ex+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a180da4e56feaee9f4cdcf63d79191a9ac71613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,24,13,164,229,111,234,238,159,76,220,246,61,121,25,26,154,199,22,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

If they doÃ¢â‚¬â€or even if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for a good laugh. The brother of patriarch Phil Robertson, Uncle Si has a limitless supply of stories about his childhood, duck hunting adventures, his days in Vietnam, and everything in between. Now the best of those tales are gathered into this roaring book.\n\nAnd as Uncle Si recounts his outlandish tales, he weaves in an up-close look into his personal life. You'll learn about his childhood life as the youngest son in the Robertson family, his college days, and his time in Vietnam. Si shares stories of the scores of marriage proposals heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s received in the mail (some with photos!), how he came to use a green Tupperware cup for his ever-present sweet tea, and how his cigarette smoke made a deer cough (heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s since quit smoking). And in many of these never-before-heard tales, Si openly talks about his wife Christina and two children, Scott and TrasaÃ¢â‚¬â€who are never seen and rarely mentioned on the show.\n\nSure to please die-hard fans and curious newbies alike, SiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one-liners are presented alongside fun, expressive photographs, as well as photos of his family. As you learn about his behind-the-scenes life, this smattering of zany stories will have you falling over with laughter and retelling them to all your friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1441f490b7b3ba567d27385080f2f6b3a06c2d05","amp;dn":"Si-cology+1+Tales+and+Wisdom+from+Duck+Dynasty%27s+Favorite+Uncle+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1441f490b7b3ba567d27385080f2f6b3a06c2d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,65,244,144,183,179,186,86,125,39,56,80,128,242,246,179,160,108,45,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

[New York] : HarperAudio, p2006.\nDescription 11 sound discs (12 hr.) : digital\nNote Unabridged.\nPerformer Performed by Dylan Baker.\nNote Compact discs.\nSummary In an ambitious effort to show whats wrong with the U.S.s current handling of gene patents and with the laws governing human tissues, the author interweaves many plot strands, one involving a California researcher, Henry Kendall, who has mixed human and chimp DNA while working at NIH. Kendall produces an intelligent hybrid whom he rescues from the government and tries to pass off as a fully human child. Some readers may be disappointed by the relative lack of action, the lame attempts to lighten the mood with humor (especially centering on an unusually bright parrot named Gerard), and the contrived convergence of the main characters toward the end.\n\nSubject Genetics -- Fiction.\nGenre Audiobooks collection -- Fiction.\nAdded Author Baker, Dylan.\nISBN 0060873094\n9780060873097\nMusic # UACD557 Harper Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5efe7edf43a0878d1e3dbd6598273861a69c89b","amp;dn":"Michael+Crichton+-+Next+-+64Kbs+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5efe7edf43a0878d1e3dbd6598273861a69c89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,239,231,237,244,58,8,120,209,227,219,214,89,130,115,134,26,105,200,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

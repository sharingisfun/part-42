These two musicians came from the band Tulus, and Khold was formed because of a desire to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“real bandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with a steady, completelineup and opportunities to play live shows. They recruited two musicians to fit the empty slots: Rinn (guitar) and Eikind (bass guitar). A demo was recorded, and late 2000 Khold was signed by Moonfog.\n\nThe first Khold album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMasterpiss of PainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, was released in 2001, with a critic referring to the album as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fresh breath upon the black metal sceneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Later in the year, Khold went touring in Europe to support the album.\n\nKholdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, Phantom, was released in 2002 through Moonfog. Since Khold at that time did not have a bass player after Eikind left the previous year, former Tulus bassist Sir Graanug was hired for the Phantom sessions. Brandr was then helping out for a couple of gigs until Grimd joined later in the year.\n\nIn the same year, Khold joined forces with Satyricon on a Nordic tour. They once again joined Satyricon for another six weeks on a European tour the following year.\n\nIn late 2003, Khold recorded their third album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMÃƒÂ¸rke gravers kammerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and also made a music video for the song Ã¢â‚¬ËœDÃƒÂ¸dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The album was released in 2004, through Candlelight Records. The following year Khold went on yet another Norwegian tour.\n\nBoth Phantom and MÃƒÂ¸rke gravers kammer were nominated for the Alarm award in the respective years of their release.\n\nIn 2006 Khold released the album 'Krek' and played a few shows before deciding to take a break. The members did some other projects but in 2008 they decided to record yet another album, 'Hundre ÃƒÂ¥r gammal'.\n\nAlthough 'Hundre ÃƒÂ¥r gammal' was released 2008 their first live appearance after the release was delayed until 2011, when they did three shows; Furustokkfestivalen, Wacken Open Air and Brutal Assault.\n\nAfter having played a couple of shows during the next year they finally decided to record a new album in june 2014. The title will be 'Til Endes' and is scheduled for release in september 2014.\nFile Name Size\n08 - Hengitt.mp3 15.15 MB\n06 - Det Dunkle Dyp.mp3 14.74 MB\n07 - Avund.mp3 12.41 MB\n03 - Ravnestrupe.mp3 12.33 MB\n02 - Skogens Oye.mp3 11.97 MB\n01 - Myr.mp3 11.94 MB\n05 - Til Endes.mp3 10.91 MB\n04 - Dommens ArmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.mp3 9.95 MB\nfolder.png 2.21 MB\ncover.jpg 75.33 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83c2c8d161ab8a0991a478f66c746751ed9f983d","amp;dn":"Khold+-+Til+Endes+++mp3+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83c2c8d161ab8a0991a478f66c746751ed9f983d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,194,200,209,97,171,138,9,145,164,120,246,108,116,103,81,237,159,152,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

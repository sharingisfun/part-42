Released in 1982, this release features a bonus song not on the original recording, the last song &quot;Favourite Branches&quot;.\n\nIf you're expecting any similarities to the Bunnymen's music, you'll be disappointed.  This is almost unlike anything out there, imagine Radiohead's &quot;Treefingers&quot; from Kid A.  No hooks, hardly any guitar, and yet captivating from beginning to end.\n\nDefinitely helps to be a Bunnymen fan, and worth hearing at least once.  If you can give it time, it absolutely grows on you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:342954eaa3263babf3d84e0f15f3c30acca99e53","amp;dn":"Will+Sergeant+-+themes+for+%27GRIND%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"342954eaa3263babf3d84e0f15f3c30acca99e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,41,84,234,163,38,59,171,243,216,78,15,21,243,195,10,204,169,158,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

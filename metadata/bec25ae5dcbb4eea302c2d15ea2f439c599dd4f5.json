The show is set in the beginning of the 22nd century and covers the interplanetary war between humanity and Neosapiens, a fictional race artificially created as slaves for the Terrans. The narration generally follows the Able Squad, an elite Terran unit of mecha pilots, on their missions all over the Solar System, although other story lines are also abundant.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosquad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosquad&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere is no official release of this entire series on home video so if you like the series please continue seeding so that other fans can download as well.

Project.\n\nCreated by OfAnthony\n\nWhat if Roger stayed? That's the concept behind the Pink Floyd What If? Project. These two &quot;imagined&quot; albums were made to represent what Floyd could have sounded like if the band stayed together. Note that these albums are not presented in the style of a compilation, but more along the lines of the classic Pink Floyd style concept album. The types of albums missed when Roger left Pink Floyd. The music is arranged according to similar lyrical themes and musical compositions, using the last two Pink Floyd albums, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994) with the solo work of Roger Water's The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (1985), When The Wind Blows Soundtrack (1986) Radio K.A.O.S (1987) and Amused To Death (1992) . Also used are two tracks from David Gilmour's second solo album About Face (1984); Here's a brief description of what each Album consists of.\n\nIRREVERSIBLE (Imagined) (1986)\n\nIrreversible contains music from Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) with Roger Waters' Radio K.A.O.S (1987), The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1985) (two tracks from the Radio K.A.O.S demos), and also two tracks from Gilmour's solo album About Face (1984).

Please seed and share, and comment. I'd like to know what people think. Also let's try and continue to spread the word that we would like to see Roger, Nick and Dave collaborate once again. *****AS OF JULY 5th 2014 PINK FLOYD HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE RELEASING A NEW ALBUM IN OCTOBER!***** Without Roger of course. Oh well!

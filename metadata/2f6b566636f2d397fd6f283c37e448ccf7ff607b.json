The potter Genjuro intends to sell his wares for vast profits in the local city, while his brother-in-law Tobei wishes to become a samurai. Their village is sacked by the marauding armies, but Genjuro's kiln miraculously survives, and they and their wives head for the city. However, Genjuro soon sends his wife Miyagi back home, promising to return to her soon, and Tobei, in his keenness to follow the samurai, abandons his wife Ohama. Meanwhile, a wealthy noblewoman, the Lady Wakasa, shows an interest in Genjuro's pots, and invites him to her mansion. \n\nGeneral\nContainer:\tMatroska\nRuntime:\t1h 36mn\nSize:\t2.03 GiB\nDXVA:\tCompatible\n\t\nVideo\nCodec:\tx264\nResolution:\t720x480 ~&gt; 720x540\nAspect ratio:\t4:3\nFrame rate:\t23.976 fps\nBit rate:\t2 692 Kbps\n\t\nAudio\n#1:\tJapanese 1.0ch AC-3 @ 192 Kbps\n#2:\t1.0ch Vorbis @ 60.0 Kbps (Commentary by filmmaker, critic, and festival programmer Tony Rayns)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f6b566636f2d397fd6f283c37e448ccf7ff607b","amp;dn":"Ugetsu+Monogatari+%28Kenji+Mizoguchi%2C+1953%29+X264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f6b566636f2d397fd6f283c37e448ccf7ff607b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,107,86,102,54,242,211,151,253,111,40,60,55,228,72,204,247,255,96,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

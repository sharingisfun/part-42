In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (published in 1979), the characters visit the legendary planet Magrathea, home to the now-collapsed planet-building industry, and meet Slartibartfast, a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the fjords of Norway. Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who built a computer named Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298396fc7432dba03608732bc17d5bb9c5ac4918","amp;dn":"Douglas+Adams+-+The+Hitchhicker%27s+Guide+To+The+Galaxy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298396fc7432dba03608732bc17d5bb9c5ac4918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,131,150,252,116,50,219,160,54,8,115,43,193,125,91,185,197,172,73,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

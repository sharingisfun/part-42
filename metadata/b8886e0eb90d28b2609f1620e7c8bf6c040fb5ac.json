Fortunately, he left us an extraordinary record of his brilliant insights, observations of nature, and touching expressions of love and affection for those around him. He also wrote frank accounts of family tragedies, physical illnesses and moments of self-doubt, as he laboured towards publication of the book that would change the way we see the world.\r\nThe story is told with the benefit of Darwin's secret notes and correspondence, enhanced by natural history filming, powerful imagery from the time and contributions from leading contemporary biographers and scientists.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8c/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Darwin-s-Struggle-The-Evolution-of-the-Origin-of-Species-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3036Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 44.1KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.33 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hd1mr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8886e0eb90d28b2609f1620e7c8bf6c040fb5ac","amp;dn":"BBC+Darwins+Struggle+The+Evolution+of+the+Origin+of+Species+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8886e0eb90d28b2609f1620e7c8bf6c040fb5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,136,110,14,185,13,40,178,96,159,22,32,231,200,191,108,4,15,181,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

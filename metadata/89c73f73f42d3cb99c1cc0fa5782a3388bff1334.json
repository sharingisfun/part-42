Luis explains committing to getting gay, we see a Jodi Arias music video, look into the Jodi Arias murder case, they pick apart Trump not doing the next debate, the candidates, the lack of respect for America, PC equality, making racists more racist, white guys being dumb fucks, a black lives matter rally gone wrong because of an Asian, and the (non) freedom of expressing opinions. We see maniacal Hillary, the guys discuss trusting politicians, Amy Schumer, â€œparallel thinking,â€ research and joke thieves, calling attention to fat shaming, they do some (a lot) fat shaming themselves, talk about East Side Daveâ€™s show, â€œnice pans,â€ drinking, comedy and drugs, Craigslist crimes, crossing the line when protecting yourself, and Bernie Goetz.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89c73f73f42d3cb99c1cc0fa5782a3388bff1334","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-27+Luis+J.+Gomez+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89c73f73f42d3cb99c1cc0fa5782a3388bff1334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,199,63,115,244,45,60,185,156,28,192,250,87,130,163,56,139,255,19,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

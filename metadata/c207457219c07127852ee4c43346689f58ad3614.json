It follows a logical approach to the various aspects of extracorporal bone and cartilage tissue engineering. The cooperation between a basic scientist and a clinician made it possible to structure the book's content and style according to the interdisciplinary character of the field. The comprehensive nature of the book, including detailed descriptions of laboratory procedures, preclinical approaches, clinical applications, and regulatory issues, will make it an invaluable basis for everyone working in this field. This book will serve as a fundamental tool for basic researchers to establish or refine tissue engineering techniques as well as for clinicians to understand and use this modern therapeutic option.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 278 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (April 11, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3540253475\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3540253471","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c207457219c07127852ee4c43346689f58ad3614","amp;dn":"Bone+and+Cartilage+Engineering%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c207457219c07127852ee4c43346689f58ad3614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,7,69,114,25,192,113,39,133,46,228,196,51,70,104,159,88,173,54,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

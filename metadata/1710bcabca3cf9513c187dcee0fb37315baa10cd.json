The\n    band documented this unique experience on high-quality video and stunning\n    audio, making up the much-anticipated release, INCUBUS HQ LIVE.\n____\nseed &amp; enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1710bcabca3cf9513c187dcee0fb37315baa10cd","amp;dn":"Incubus-HQ_Live-2012-MTD+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1710bcabca3cf9513c187dcee0fb37315baa10cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,16,188,171,202,60,249,81,60,24,125,206,224,251,55,49,91,170,16,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

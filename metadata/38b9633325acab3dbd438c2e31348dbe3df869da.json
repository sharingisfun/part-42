Uploaded the wrong audio. This still\n has the other blip but atleast now you can watch with the audio.\n\n As for Lost Girl, we'll address that in the morning. However all \n signs point to it being in the original broadcast. So really you/we\n have two choices. One we wait for a rerun in 4 days and not pre and people\n go nuts over where is it or, we pre and you can watch it for the most part \n and it's not perfect. That and who said the reair would be fine. In the past\n Showcase hasn't fixed these issues for the reair. We know we've waited. LOSE\n LOSE for us and you.\n\n Previously on 2HD going crazy..\n\n \n We're sorry this is late but we've been experiencing some issues with \n our Cartoon Network feed these past couple of days. There might be some \n minor glitches on this release. We asked FQM and they didn't have the \n episode recorded. Our apologies but there's no other rerun scheduled\n so we thought it would be better to have the episode out there then not\n at all.\n\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;45212a362034302c360526373c35312a28242c296b2a3722&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b9633325acab3dbd438c2e31348dbe3df869da","amp;dn":"Thundercats.2011.S01E09.REPACK.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38b9633325acab3dbd438c2e31348dbe3df869da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,185,99,51,37,172,171,61,189,67,140,46,49,52,141,190,61,248,105,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

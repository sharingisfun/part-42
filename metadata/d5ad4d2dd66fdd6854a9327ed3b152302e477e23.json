He also\n      tries to find answers to questions such as how do chickens\n      communicate with their chicks? How can chickens look in two\n      directions at once? And can hens really change sex?\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?

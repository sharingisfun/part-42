The book was used as the basis for The Botany of Desire, a two-hour program broadcast by PBS.\n\nThis work explores the nature of domesticated plants from the dual perspective of humans and the plants themselves. Pollan presents case studies that mirror four types of human desires that are reflected in the way that we selectively grow, breed, and genetically engineer our plants. The apple reflects the desire of sweetness, the tulip beauty, marijuana intoxication, and the potato control.\n\nPollan narrates his own experience with each of the plants, which he then intertwines with an exploration into their social history. Each section presents an element of human domestication, or the &quot;human bumblebee&quot; as Pollan calls us. The stories range from the true story of Johnny Appleseed to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana hybrids in Amsterdam to the paradigm-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873a0200cf4f287b8f00a61079a39ccdff08d244","amp;dn":"The.Botany.Of.Desire.Xvid.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873a0200cf4f287b8f00a61079a39ccdff08d244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,58,2,0,207,79,40,123,143,0,166,16,121,163,156,205,255,8,210,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

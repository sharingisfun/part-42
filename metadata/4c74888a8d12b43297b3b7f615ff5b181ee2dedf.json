This special commission allows Murcof to find full integration between all the elements in his sound, whether acoustic, analogue or digital. Strings, pixelations, brass, digital sweeps and video beams become a single whole in this new audiovisual composition. Collaborating with a viola, cellist and trombone players from Spanish classical ensemble Bcn216, Murcof will allow the unique qualities of acoustic instruments to mix with microbeats and vast digital atmospherics, letting tracks shift and mutate in aminimal environment. This will be an immersive experience.\n\nby Wiktorpl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c74888a8d12b43297b3b7f615ff5b181ee2dedf","amp;dn":"Murcof+-+The+Versailles+Sessions+-+2008+-+Wiktorpl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c74888a8d12b43297b3b7f615ff5b181ee2dedf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,116,136,138,141,18,180,50,151,179,183,246,21,255,91,24,30,226,222,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

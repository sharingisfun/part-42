IÃ‚Â´ve also cancelled my SWTOR account and stated the same reasons when I did it. ENJOY PPL and please thank me or write something when you have tried it :) . (You can just alt-tab when you start it up and see NO dlc error message and after you checked your normandy-messages and write something here as thanks :) ).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6babfe9e8578e225a18fb955d49787e74b9936dd","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+3+DLC+FIX+%28100%25+working%2C+%2AHOW+TO%2A+inside+if+preferre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6babfe9e8578e225a18fb955d49787e74b9936dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,171,254,158,133,120,226,37,161,143,185,85,212,151,135,231,75,153,54,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

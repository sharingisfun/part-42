Now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out to make SookieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world come crashing down.\nUnabridged.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nFor the very latest audiobook releases visit:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n---------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87b8ae72d3e1b831a72f5f7c65b74eb46d42bf7","amp;dn":"Deadlocked+%5BSookie+Stackhouse%5D+%26ndash%3B+Charlaine+Harris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87b8ae72d3e1b831a72f5f7c65b74eb46d42bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,123,138,231,45,62,27,131,26,114,245,247,198,91,116,235,70,212,43,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Their wildly popular barbecue joints have earned them fame, fortune, devoted fans and a lot of big toys. But no matter how big their business grows, the boisterous, fun-loving clan insists on running the business as a family. Add in all the colorful employees and regulars and it's obvious: This down-home joint is a real-life sitcom.\n\n\n\nThe Shed - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\nSomething Old, Something New, Something BBQ\n\nWhen Brad enlists the Shed's catering services for a friend's wedding, things quickly spiral out of hand. First the bride requests the Shed cook a whole hog for the reception, which is a four day process that she needs finished in less than two. But the icing on the situation is the wedding cake, which Mama Shed and Hobson must attempt to cook in the barbecue smoker. Her off-menu order for crawfish falls upon Coal Miner and Big Hoss, who after failing to trap enough of the critters, must buy, clean and cook them... all of which creates a huge challenge for Brad and the Shed crew to get to the church on time!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 04-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5837dc9412c5d64310c039c1ae47f73187bd57","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E01.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5837dc9412c5d64310c039c1ae47f73187bd57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,88,55,220,148,18,197,214,67,16,192,57,193,174,71,247,49,135,189,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

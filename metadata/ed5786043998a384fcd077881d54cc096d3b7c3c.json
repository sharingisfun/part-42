About 130 people turned up to see Romi Mori (Japan), Nick Sanderson (U.K.), Rainer Lingk (Germany, from Berlin band Die Haut) in this &quot;all-American band&quot; as Jeffrey Lee Pierce presented them.\n\nThe core of their well orchestrated 95 minute set was very much the same as that of their March 1992 European tour. Added to that were five songs from their recent (and excellent) &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; album. \n\nNew man Rainer did a great job on guitar, his playing even more effective and notable than with his main band Die Haut. He performed with great confidence as though being with the band since the very beginning.\n\nJeffrey Lee, all dressed in black and with a black cowboy hat, never smiling and barely saying a word to the audience between songs, played extremely concentrated and tight. At one stage he even asked to leave the white spotlights on so he could watch his guitar strings whilst playing &quot;this really difficult song, man&quot; (&quot;Up Above The World&quot;). \n\nThere are not many bands around who can play meaningful guitar solos, but the Gun Club managed to play a whole string of exciting and entertaining licks. It's remarkable how well the new and the old songs blended and formed a new and strong whole. Mid set, Jeffrey Lee put away his guitar and --for old time's sake-- did vocals only on &quot;Bad Indian&quot;, &quot;Thunderhead&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Johnny.&quot; The whole crowd went wild. I don't think good old Jeffrey has ever looked and played better than these days. A great show!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed5786043998a384fcd077881d54cc096d3b7c3c","amp;dn":"The+Gun+Club+-+1993-04-30+Kortrijk%2C+Belgium+-+AUD+94.40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed5786043998a384fcd077881d54cc096d3b7c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,87,134,4,57,152,163,132,252,208,119,136,29,84,204,9,109,59,124,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

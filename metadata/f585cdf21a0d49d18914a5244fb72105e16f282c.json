Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously depart.\n\nYears later, a teenaged Peter attends Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson and has caught the eye of the beautiful Gwen Stacy. At home, Peter finds his father's papers and learns he worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a &quot;biocable&quot; is under development from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he discovers that he has developed spider-like abilities.\n\nAfter studying Richard's papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richard Parker's son and gives Connors his father's &quot;decay rate algorithm&quot;, the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs. Amazed by the formula Peter gives, he asks Peter if he would visit him again in his lab after school, to which Peter agrees. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the terminally ill (but unseen) head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. In school, Peter gets into trouble after a basketball challenge with Flash in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. He is rebuked by his Uncle Ben that he had to change work shifts in order to meet with the principal and asks Peter to replace him walking home with Aunt May that night. Peter deliberately ignores Ben's order and helps Connors regenerate the limb of a laboratory mouse. When he comes home, Uncle Ben is angry at Peter for not picking up Aunt May and leads into an argument, and then Peter storms out of the house to the streets. At a nearby grocery store, the clerk disallows him a drink for being two cents short, and when a thief suddenly raids the store, Peter indifferently observes and lets the thief escape in exchange for revenge on the store clerk. While searching for Peter, Uncle Ben attempts to stop the thief but is killed. The thief flees as Peter finds Ben dead on the sidewalk and mourns for his death. Then, as he and Aunt May are informed about the killer, Peter realizes it was the thief he should've stopped from the grocery store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f585cdf21a0d49d18914a5244fb72105e16f282c","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Spiderman+2012+PORsubDELUXE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f585cdf21a0d49d18914a5244fb72105e16f282c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,205,242,26,13,73,209,137,20,165,36,79,183,33,5,225,111,40,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

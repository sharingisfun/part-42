In DRIVING AMBITION he gives a candid account of the highs and lows of his remarkable career for Middlesex and England. An outstanding opening batsman and natural leader, Andrew Strauss captained his country in 50 of his 100 Tests. During his time in charge, England emerged from a turbulent and controversial period to become the world's top team. This is an honest and entertaining story of a quiet, modest but fiercely ambitious man who became a magnificent man-manager, leading England to victory in the 2009 Ashes series and again in Australia the following year. Strauss is a fine raconteur and this revealing autobiography will appeal to all those who love cricket","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ce401145603b24d7289b0358102eb70cde2aca","amp;dn":"Driving+Ambition+-+Andrew+Strauss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ce401145603b24d7289b0358102eb70cde2aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,206,64,17,69,96,59,36,215,40,155,3,88,16,46,183,12,222,42,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

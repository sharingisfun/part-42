This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nBread debuts their new hit, &quot;If&quot; (at number 39) and Neil Diamond debuts his song &quot;I Am, I Said&quot; (at number 26).\n\nThere is a hit by the man who was the singing voice of Steve McQueen in the 1965 motion picture &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall.&quot;\n\nThere is the current hit by a man who once found himself in the recording studio with a bad cold recording a song he didn't like. Casey says that song became his only number one hit.\n\nThree Dog Night moves their song &quot;Joy To The World&quot; from number 34 last week to number 11 this week.\n\nAs in-show specials, Casey plays the first song ever by a country and western star to hit number one on the national pop charts and the highest debuting record in the history of the record charts (started off at number 2).\n\nThere is a hit by a British singing star whose tonsils are a national monument. Casey says when he had them removed they were preserved in a glass jar and put on public display.\n\nWhen I don't list songs such as Extra number 2 (&quot;Closer To Home&quot; by Grand Funk Railroad) it is because that song wasn't part of the original broadcast. Premier took it from another broadcast and that's why Casey introduces it; it is from some other show.\n\nAlso, there is a slight but noticeable hiss in the audio. Nothing I could do, that's the way it came over the internet. It is still an enjoyable show.\n\n40: Ask Me No Questions - B.B.

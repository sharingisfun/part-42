The land is in peril. A child has been born to save his people. But a traitor lurks with evil in his mind and murder in his heart, dogging the footsteps of those who protect the babe who would be king. But magic is at work, high magic. Gwydion the Dreamer awakes, screaming, from a prophetic dream of tragedy and loss, a dream peopled by kings of the past. Though he thinks he is not ready, the Shining Ones lay a task upon him: protect young Arthur; and locate Caladfwlch, the lost sword of the last, murdered High King of Kymru. Dodging assassins to find the woman who holds the key to unlock a horrible secret, and fighting the longings of his own shattered heart, Gwydion sets out upon his odyssey. And finds that fate cannot be fulfilled without sacrificing the life of someone he loves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3901b1822ffb45e9f94b9fc676b12d7ac604e929","amp;dn":"Night+Birds+Reign+%5BThe+Dreamer%27s+Cycle%2C+%231%5D+-+Holly+Taylor.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3901b1822ffb45e9f94b9fc676b12d7ac604e929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,1,177,130,47,251,69,233,249,75,159,198,118,177,45,122,198,4,233,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

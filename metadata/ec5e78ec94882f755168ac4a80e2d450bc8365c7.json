A notable cast included William Shatner as the Chief JAG Prosecutor Norton Parker Chipman, Jack Cassidy (who was nominated for an Emmy) as Wirzs defense counsel, Cameron Mitchell as Lew Wallace, a Union general and the future author of Ben-Hur, and Buddy Ebsen as a Georgia physician called in to testify about the fate of many of the Union prisoners.\n\nThe television adaptation was directed by actor George C. Scott, who had played Chipman in the original stage version.\n\nIn Leonard Probsts 1978 compilation of celebrity interviews, Off Camera, Scott explained that what he found most difficult about playing Chipman onstage was that Henry Wirz, the defendant, came across as a tragic victim, although his negligence, according to the verdict, had a great deal to do with the deplorable conditions at Andersonville, and Scott found it very difficult to deal with the fact that the audience was compelled to dislike Chipman, who was, essentially, the hero of the piece.\n\nThe TV production of the play won 1971 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Single Program, for Technical Direction and Electronic Camerawork, and for Levitts adaptation. It was also honored with a Peabody Award.\n\nWilliam Shatner as Lt. Col. Norton P. Chipman\nCameron Mitchell as Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace\nRichard Basehart as Capt.

The site of the prison is now Andersonville National Historic Site in Andersonville, Georgia. Most of the site actually lies in extreme southwestern Macon County, adjacent to the east side of Andersonville. It includes the site of the Civil War prison, the Andersonville National Cemetery and the National Prisoner of War Museum. In all, 12,913 of the approximately 45,000 Union prisoners died there because of starvation, malnutrition, diarrhea, and disease.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5e78ec94882f755168ac4a80e2d450bc8365c7","amp;dn":"Andersonville+Trial+%281970+Emmy+Winner%29+William+Shatner%2C+George+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5e78ec94882f755168ac4a80e2d450bc8365c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,94,120,236,148,136,47,117,81,104,172,74,128,226,212,80,188,131,101,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

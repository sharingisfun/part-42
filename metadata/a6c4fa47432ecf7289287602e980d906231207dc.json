Translated by Denver Lindley.\n\nISBN: 9780140013207 | 352 pages | EPUB\n\n\nCONFESSIONS OF FELIX KRULL is an unfinished 1954 comic novel by Thomas Mann (1875-1955).  It recounts the career of an irresistible con-man extraordinaire who is unhampered by the moral precepts that govern the conduct of ordinary people.  It is a parody of Goethe's autobiography &quot;Poetry and Truth&quot;, particularly in its pompous tone.\n\nThe character of Felix Krull originally appeared in a short story written in 1911 (&quot;Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull&quot;).  Mann later expanded the story and managed to finish and publish Part One of the Confessions before his death in 1955.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c4fa47432ecf7289287602e980d906231207dc","amp;dn":"Thomas+Mann+-+Confessions+of+Felix+Krull+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c4fa47432ecf7289287602e980d906231207dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,196,250,71,67,46,207,114,137,40,118,2,233,128,217,6,35,18,7,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A new recording that most had only heard of was the SMiLE Era Party, which features Brian recording a dinner party at his home.\nDisc 2 has many out-takes / alternate versions along with the sound track from Brian&amp;#039;s performance on TV of &quot;Surf&amp;#039;s Up&quot;.\nThe set was also issued in a 3 Lp set of yellow, green and blue vinyl.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e048d38fa6b6b78efe485f1f3210aa1734e3b7","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+VigOtone+110_111++SMiLE.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e048d38fa6b6b78efe485f1f3210aa1734e3b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,224,72,211,143,166,182,183,142,254,72,95,31,50,16,170,23,52,227,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

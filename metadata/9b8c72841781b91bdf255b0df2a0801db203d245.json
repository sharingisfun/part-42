Includes performances of &quot;Fly Me Away&quot;, &quot;Train&quot;, &quot;Number 1&quot;, &quot;Satin Chic&quot;, &quot;Ooh La La&quot;, and &quot;Strict Machine&quot;.\n\nCaptured from a BBCi DVB-T channel and converted to MP4 stream, H.264/AVC video, and AAC audio.  Includes chapter stops for each song.\n\nLength: 28m 39s.\nFrame: 720x576, 25 fps, PAL 16:9.\n\nNote, there is a minor video glitch at 06:40 from my original capture, during &quot;Train&quot;, but the camera is panning over the audience at the time so it doesn&amp;#039;t spoil it too much.  There are no audio glitches apart from a couple of on-stage instrument failures. ;-)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b8c72841781b91bdf255b0df2a0801db203d245","amp;dn":"Goldfrapp+-+Live+at+T+in+the+Park+-+2006-07-08+%28H264+AAC%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b8c72841781b91bdf255b0df2a0801db203d245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,140,114,132,23,129,185,27,223,37,91,13,242,160,128,29,178,3,210,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

No more switching between views or zooming in and out.\n\nI cut up the original pages and relayed them out on a 1280x800 pixel space. The result: individual panels fill up the screen, allowing for a more cinematic reading experience and greater appreciation of the details and nuances of Steve McNiven&amp;#039;s beautiful artwork.\n\nMuch thanks to the originals scanners. I retained their credit page but any changes from their original work, color errors and all are to be blamed on me.\n\nPlease buy this book, it&amp;#039;s really awesome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180178592f83a120fa579b727adbc2ec25029cec","amp;dn":"Wolverine+067+%282008%29+-+Widescreen+Edition+%28check+it+out%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180178592f83a120fa579b727adbc2ec25029cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,1,120,89,47,131,161,32,250,87,155,114,122,219,194,236,37,2,156,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

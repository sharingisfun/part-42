Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always good at effectively removing it. The majority of Anti-Malware Scanners are well able to detect malicious software Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Trojan Horses, Internet Worms, Adware/Spyware etc. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but are not always efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.\n\nThese programs have the ability to track your browsing habits and even steal such personal information as bank account numbers and passwords. Spyware has the power to install more parasites on your computer without your consent. Everything you do and everything you type is being recorded right now! Companies know what your interests are! Hackers will access your PC and do anything they wish. They can even steal your Identity and You would never be the wiser!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0a2730f50ffc81a3bd249f2e18876ffbe9b36e","amp;dn":"Loaris+Trojan+Remover+v1.3.7.2+Multilingual.%2BPatch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0a2730f50ffc81a3bd249f2e18876ffbe9b36e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,10,39,48,245,15,252,129,163,189,36,159,46,24,135,111,251,233,179,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

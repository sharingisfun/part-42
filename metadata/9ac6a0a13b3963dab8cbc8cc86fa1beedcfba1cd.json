It contains an even greater depth of industrial information, focussing on how copper metal is extracted from ore and scrap, and how this extraction could be made more efficient. \r\nModern high intensity smelting processes are presented in detail, specifically flash, Contop, Isasmelt, Noranda, Teniente and direct-to-blister smelting. Considerable attention is paid to the control of SO2 emissions and manufacture of H2SO4. Recent developments in electrorefining, particularly stainless steel cathode technology are examined. Leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning are evaluated together with their impact upon optimizing mineral resource utilization. The book demonstrates how recycling of copper and copper alloy scrap is an important source of copper and copper alloys. Copper quality control is also discussed and the book incorporates an important section on extraction economics. \r\nEach chapter is followed by a summary of concepts previously described and offers suggested further reading and references","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac6a0a13b3963dab8cbc8cc86fa1beedcfba1cd","amp;dn":"Extractive+Metallurgy+of+Copper+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac6a0a13b3963dab8cbc8cc86fa1beedcfba1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,198,160,161,59,57,99,218,184,203,200,204,134,250,27,238,220,251,161,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

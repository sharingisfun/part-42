History has identified the period \nfollowing the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a \nterrible time when civilisation stopped. \n\nWaldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark \nAges were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions \nprovoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across \nEurope, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and \ndiscovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually \nan 'Age of Light'. \n\nAlong with Christianity, the Dark Ages saw the emergence of another vital \nreligion - Islam. After emerging in the near East it spread across North Africa \nand into Europe, bringing its unique artistic style with it. Waldemar examines \nthe early artistic explorations of the first Muslims, the development of their \nmosques and their scientific achievements.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8372ed670316b111787c03235c3cbcd7527cdefa","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Dark+Ages%2C+An+Age+Of+Light+3+of+4+The+Wonder+Of+Islam+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8372ed670316b111787c03235c3cbcd7527cdefa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,114,237,103,3,22,177,17,120,124,3,35,92,60,188,215,82,124,222,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

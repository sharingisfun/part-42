Hopefully, not in the tires.\n\n Elsewhere, Steve promised his wife he'd fix her Volvo,\n  but after sneaking off to three different mechanics,\n   he still can't figure out the problem.\n\n Also, should Frances trade her trusty Miata for her uncle's beloved,\n    but un-trustworthy Porsche;\n\n is half-way good enough for the spark plug Chuck cross-threaded; \n   \n   and, can Rebecca make it home for the holidays in her ancient Chevy,\n     or will the next NPR fundraiser be dedicated to buying her a plane ticket? \n\n\n\nAll this, and more, this week on Car Talk.

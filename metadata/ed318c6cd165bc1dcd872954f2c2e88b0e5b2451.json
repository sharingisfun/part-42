It is a vast and stirring work described as what the Bible might have been had it been written by GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughters instead of sons. \n\nFar beyond the traditional women-of-the-Bible sagas in both impact and vigor, The Red Tent is based upon a mention in Genesis of JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only female offspringÃ¢â‚¬â€his daughter, Dinah. \n\nAuthor Anita Diamant, in the voice of Dinah, gives an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s look at the details of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives in biblical times and a chronicle of their earthy stories and long-ignored histories. The red tent of the title is the place where women were sequestered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and illness. It is here that Dinah hears the whispered stories of her four mothersÃ¢â‚¬â€JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wives Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and BilhahÃ¢â‚¬â€and tells their tales to us in remarkable and thought-provoking oratories. Familiar passages from the Bible take on new life as Dinah fills in what the Bible has left outÃ¢â‚¬â€the lives of women. Dinah tells us of her initiation into the religious and sexual practices of the tribe; JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s courtship with Rachel and Leah; the ancient world of caravans, farmers, midwives, and slaves; her ill-fated sojourn in the city of Sechem; her years in Canaan; and her half-brother JosephÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise in Egypt.\n\nSkillfully interweaving biblical tales with characters of her own invention, the author re-creates the life of Dinah providing an illuminating portrait of a courageous woman and the life she might have lived. A new view of the panorama of life in biblical times emerges from the female perspective, and the red tent itself becomes a symbol of womanly strength, love, and wisdom.\n\nThe Red Tent is one of those extremely rare publishing phenomenonsÃ¢â‚¬â€a little promoted, but dynamically successful book (over 250,000 copies sold) that owes its success to enthusiastic word-of-mouth endorsements. Now, for the first time, this sweeping saga, which has struck a chord with so many modern-day women, comes to life as a much-anticipated audiobook.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio; Unabridged edition (January 5, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1559277092\nISBN-13: 978-1559277099\nProduct Dimensions: 5.7 x 5.4 x 1.5 inches\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.

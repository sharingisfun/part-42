He discusses the methods used to detect possible signals from other civilizations and the ways that the space sciences are changing as a result of this new field. â€œAre we alone?â€ is a mystery that has forever fascinated mankind, gaining momentum by scientists since the 1995 discovery of the existence of exoplanets began to inspire new ways of thinking in astronomy. Here, Linde tries to answer many philosophical questions that derive from this area of research: Is humanity facing a change of paradigm, that we are not unique as intelligent beings? Is it possible to communicate with others out there, and even if we can?should we?\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nPeter Linde has been fascinated by astronomy since childhood and is involved in many projects that convey this commitment in popular science form. Previously, he worked as an assistant professor in astronomy at Lund University, Sweden. As a researcher, he has been active in advanced analysis of astronomical imagery, participating in studies of solar-type stars and stellar populations in nearby galaxies. Recently, he has been engaged in simulations for the European Extremely Large Telescope, which is now being built. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1. A Cosmic Perspective ...... 1\r\n2.

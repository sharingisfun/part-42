Part 1 of 3 with the inboxes ranging from the letters A to I. More parts to follow as soon as WikiLeaks releases them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Q&amp;A]\r\n\r\nQ: Why are there just 165,342 emails in this torrent? WikiLeaks said there are 294,548 in their release!\r\nA: Roughly 44% of the emails are duplicates just consuming disk space. Therefore the duplicates are omitted.\r\n\r\nQ: Why is this packed?\r\nA: There are 165,342 files to distribute. A *.torrent for such a massive amount of files would have a lunatic filesize. Moreover, with compression the torrent's size was more than halved, making it easier to download.\r\n\r\nQ: What? 165,342 files?! Why?\r\nA: Every email is inside a seperate *.imap file.\r\n\r\nQ: What is that 7z format?\r\nA: It is the file format of 7-Zip, an open-source packer under the GNU LGPL license. It has compression performance way superior to that of ZIP an RAR (including RAR5).\r\n\r\nQ: Can I preview this archive?\r\nA: 7-Zip uses solid compression by design, but due to variable solid block size it is most likely possible to preview the archive the same way as a RAR archive.\r\n\r\nQ: Is this archive passworded?\r\nA: No.\r\n\r\nQ: How can I open an *.imap file?\r\nA: Just use a text editor, e.g. Windows Notepad or Notepad++","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b5afdd9baed9368699d99a289d2a5fba769a71","amp;dn":"WikiLeaks+-+Turkey%27s+AKP+party+emails+archive+database+%28A+to+I%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b5afdd9baed9368699d99a289d2a5fba769a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,181,175,221,155,174,217,54,134,153,217,154,40,157,42,95,186,118,154,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

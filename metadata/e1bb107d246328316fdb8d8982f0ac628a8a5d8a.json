CrossOver includes an easy to use, single click interface, which makes installing a Windows application simple and fast. Once installed, your application integrate seamlessly with your Gnome or KDE environment. Just click and run your application, exactly as you would in Windows, but with the full freedom of Linux.\n\nCrossOver Linux lets you use many Windows plugins directly from your Linux browser. Plugins work on any x86 based Linux distribution and will integrate with most browsers including Firefox 1.x, Netscape 6.x, Konqueror, Mozilla, and Opera. CrossOver also integrates with Gnome and KDE to let you transparently open any Word, Excel or PowerPoint file. But even better, you can open these attachment types directly from any mail client.\n\n\nMac:\n\nCrossOver Mac allows you to install many popular Windows applications and games on your Intel OS X Mac. CrossOver includes an easy to use, single click interface, which makes installing Windows software simple and fast. Once installed, your application integrates seamlessly in OS X. Just click and run your application directly from the OS X Finder. Clicking a Windows file or document ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ including email attachments ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ will launch the appropriate Windows program, allowing you to work on the files. Best of all, you do it all easily and affordably, without needing a Microsoft operating system license.\n\nAdding new Windows software is easy. Just place your install CD in your Intel Mac, and CrossOver will recognize it and offer to begin the installation process. CrossOver then completes the installation and configures your application to run on your Mac. That's all there is to it.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Runs All CrossOver-Supported Windows Applications:\n-CrossOver Games Included:\n-Enhanced Deployability Features:\n-Multi-User Support:\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nCrossOver Mac contains support for English and Japanese.\n-Intel-based Macintosh system running Mac OS X (note: CrossOver will not run on PowerPC systems)\n-120 MB of free disk space\n-Both Tiger (10.4.x) and Leopard (10.5.x) are supported, but Leopard requires CrossOver 6.2 or later.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n7.0.2 CrossOver Mac - July 7, 2008\n\nBug fixes:\n[-] Fixed a bug in 7.0 which prevented printing in upgraded installs.\n[-] Fixed running of Office 2000 and Office XP on some 64-bit machines.\n[-] Fixed a saving failure in some Word 2003 and Excel 2003 documents.\n[=] Re-enabled use of the 'default bottle' on the Mac.\n\n7.0.0 CrossOver Mac - June 17, 2008\n\nNew application support:\n[+] Office 2007 (Including Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and limited Outlook)\n[+] Photoshop CS and CS2\n\nBug fixes:\n[-] Greatly improved online banking integration in Quicken 2007 and 2008\n[-] Fixed service pack support for several versions of Office\n[+] Improved IE support in win2000 and winxp bottles (though win98 is still better)\n[+] Improved support for modern Linux distributions (especially Ubuntu)\n[*] This build also includes countless wine fixes. Many small bugs should be fixed, and unsupported application behavior should be greatly improved.\n\n\nLinux:\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nx86 compatible PC system, 200 MHz or higher\n(400 MHz+ recommended for QuickTime)\nLinux distribution (32 bit, or 64 bit with 32 bit compatibility library installed)\n\nTested on: (not by me)\nUbuntu 6.06/7.04(1)\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4 and 5 (2)\nopenSUSE 10.2\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10\nFedora Core 6 and 7 (3)\n\nIf a distribution is listed here, that means two things: our regression suite had to pass on that distribution before we would ship, and that we are ready and able to support customers that use that distribution. Note that prior to running our regression test, each test system was updated to its most current patch set as of September 1, 2007. We test on both 32 bit and 64 bit systems running each distribution, and, where possible, we test both KDE and Gnome.\n\n(1) Ubuntu 7.04 has a font that can cause problems in CrossOver. See this FAQ for more information.\n(2) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 uses a form of SELinux that does not allow CrossOver to function properly by default. Their default tool will allow you to customize permissions to allow it to work, however.\n(3) Fedora Core has a range of experimental technologies that often break Wine, and therefore CrossOver. You will likely have to change your system in order to get CrossOver to work, particularly on 64 bit systems.\n\nYou should be able to run this on a variety of other distributions, particularly older versions of the distributions listed here. However, our ability to test and support older or other configurations is somewhat limited. Gentoo users in particular should note that we do not install or test on Gentoo, nor do we have any plans to do so, so you should use CrossOver at your own risk. We have many customers happily using Gentoo, but we also have a high number of users with problems on Gentoo.\n\n-Glibc 2.3.x or greater\n-X11R6 3.3 or greater. XFree86 4 with XRender and FreeType support is recommended\n\nLinux web browser (one or more of the following)\n-Firefox 1.x\n-Netscape 6.1 or greater\n-Mozilla 1.2 or greater\n-Galeon or SkipStone based on Mozilla 1.2 or greater\n-Konqueror 2.2.2 or greater\n-Opera 5.05 or greater\nNote: CrossOver supports 64-bit browsers as well.\n\n-50 MB of free disk space\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n7.0.2 CrossOver Linux - July 7, 2008\n\nBug fixes:\n[-] Fixed a bug in 7.0 which prevented printing in upgraded installs.\n[-] Fixed running of Office 2000 and Office XP on some 64-bit machines.\n[-] Fixed a saving failure in some Word 2003 and Excel 2003 documents.\n\n7.0.0 CrossOver Linux - June 17, 2008\n\nNew application support:\n[+] Office 2007 (Including Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and limited Outlook)\n[+] Photoshop CS and CS2\n\nBug fixes:\n[-] Greatly improved online banking integration in Quicken 2007 and 2008\n[-] Fixed service pack support for several versions of Office\n[+] Improved IE support in win2000 and winxp bottles (though win98 is still better)\n[+] Improved support for modern Linux distributions (especially Ubuntu)\n[*] This build also includes countless wine fixes.

This FullertonÃ‚Â´s sextet  were known as the Living Suns until time ago, when the group decided  switched gears musically, as well, moved away from  rock &amp; roll for  dive into a new sound, they say that this ocurred all thanks to god Dahga \n\nWith six people armed with an variety of instruments played  with precision knowing  how  maintain  their psychedelic sound yet   melodic  and catchy with  trippy wits and  droning  coastal .\n\nI was watching some interviews to the  band as for know about their influences or process in the creation of his songs which although structurally complex all times maintain their quality experimental without losing the groove, but i found that  they  only says silly things to the pollster. Anyway  their  music is totally legit  and we  only judge them by what we hear Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nENJOY AND SHARE PLEASE\n\nwearethelastbeatniks.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f82851c82e76be7b7fb313de0273280467cfe8e","amp;dn":"DAHGA+BLOOM+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f82851c82e76be7b7fb313de0273280467cfe8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,130,133,28,130,231,107,231,183,251,49,61,224,39,50,128,70,124,254,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

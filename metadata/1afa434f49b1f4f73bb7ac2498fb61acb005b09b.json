JAFFA is quite pleased to be able to\nbring you everything (of note) that this great band put down on record. Red Roses For Me was originally issued in 1984.\n\n\n&quot;What set the Pogues apart from any number of other energetic Irish traditional bands was the sheer physical force of\ntheir performances, the punky swagger of their personalities, and Shane MacGowan's considerable gifts as a songwriter.\nUnfortunately, none of these qualities come through very clearly on their first album, Red Roses for Me. While the Pogues\nare in good form here, the production (by Stan Brennan) is thin and lacks the body or nuance to capture the finer details\nof the performances, robbing this recording of the fire the group would display on their later albums. And it's clear that\nShane MacGowan had not yet fully matured as a songwriter; there are a handful of superb songs here, such as &quot;Transmetro-\npolitan,&quot; &quot;Streams of Whiskey,&quot; and &quot;Down in the Ground Where the Dead Men Go,&quot; but some of the others suggest MacGowan was\nstill learning how to fit all his ideas into his songs. Red Roses for Me is good and rowdy fun, but on Run, Sodomy &amp; the Lash\nand If I Should Fall From Grace With God, the Pogues would prove they were capable of a lot more than that.&quot;  (AMG)\n\nhttp://www.pogues.com\n\n\n---\n\n\nGroup News: JAFFA is looking for: A few good men. Or women. You can probably guess what for.. You have\nto be a totally hard-core bad-ass individual who's on irc 24/7, but at the same time we don't want uber-\nserious, super-boring ones, nor opportunists, nor those who speak lies. Nor robinson-jerry. Also, you\nhave to be 18 years old minimum, and like Music a lot, and be familiar with, or at least have heard of,\nbands/artists such as Ramones, Dropkick Murphys, or Flogging Molly. That's it. If you think you fit the bill,\nall that's left to do is to somehow get in touch with the JAFFA Supreme Overmind. Someone you know may know\nsomeone else who has in turn once spoken to someone that..etc, etc, etc. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afa434f49b1f4f73bb7ac2498fb61acb005b09b","amp;dn":"The_Pogues-Red_Roses_For_Me-Remastered-2004-JAFFA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afa434f49b1f4f73bb7ac2498fb61acb005b09b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,250,67,79,73,177,244,247,59,183,172,36,152,251,97,172,176,5,176,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

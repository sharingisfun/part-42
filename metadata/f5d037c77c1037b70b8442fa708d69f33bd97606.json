You are confronted by someone or with a circumstance or something that causes you to feel a tightening in your 'gut', a rapid heart rate, maybe a shortness of breath, a feeling of something bad getting ready to happen to you, an apprehension or fear of the unknown, or an excitement about the best fulfillment of everything you have ever dreamed. You feel the fear of the uncertainty or certainty of something you do or don't want to happen. Or worse, you feel afraid or just plain scared of what the possible changes that accompany your situation may have on you, your surrounding circumstances, and your life or the lives of those you care about. \n\nThe good news is that people have positive options when confronted with fear and apprehension inducing situations, whether related to good or bad anticipations. You can stand up to situations confronting you and fight back so you can win out over the apprehension and fear you feel to claim and complete the outcomes you want.  And many do this quite successfully!\n\nThe bad news is that some haven't yet learned how to effectively use the positive options they have available to them in ways that produce the best results that could be achieved for them. They tend to just run away from challenges and circumstances that create the fearful and anxiety producing situations presenting to them rather than positively dealing with them either directly or indirectly. They have learned that it is often just easier to run away from something or someone that frightens them or makes them anxious.  And they oftentimes just don't do so well when it comes to fighting back and taking charge of the fear and uncertainties or certainties they encounter that could help them achieve what is best for them and their circumstances. Most of the time, this is because they have never been taught or learned how to live boldly and unafraid in conquering the fear of impending change and maintaining holistic control over it so they can effectively use it to help them be and have what they want. \n\nThe good news is that learning how to live boldly and unafraid of fear and changing circumstances can help any person who chooses to do so live beyond his or her limits in achieving what he or she can think, imagine, and perceive. \n\n&quot;Living Bold And Unafraid Of Change&quot; is a guide for soaring with wings like an eagle to conquer any fear and change any state of being you desire to fly as high as you can think, imagine, and believe!\n\nIt shows you what living bold and unafraid means, why it is so important, and how to go about doing it. &quot;Living Boldly And Unafraid Of Change&quot; defines clearly how to use the power of change and it's limitless possibilities to boldly achieve anything that is in harmony with God and the Universe. It teaches you how to create or embrace change that leads to the achievement of any new or altered state of being of yourself or anything that you dare to believe. It takes you step by step from thoughts and imaginations of change to activating state of being changes that you dare to believe through living boldly and unafraid in helping actualize the transformation of what you want, dream, and believe to be your 'true' realities.\n\nThe principles in &quot;Living Bold And Unafraid Of Change&quot; and the entire The Spirit Of Winning Book Series will help you be harmoniously empowered to boldly move beyond where you have been and arrive at where you want to go as you claim and complete the certainty of already being there -- here!\n\nIt will help you live boldly and unafraid to become and achieve anything you can imagine that is in harmony with God and orderly Universal energy and forces.\n\nAfter you have read &quot;Living Bold And Unafraid Of Change&quot;, please be so kind to review and share your response with others.

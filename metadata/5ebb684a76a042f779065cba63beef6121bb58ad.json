Where did we get the F-word\nand the C-word from? Where do we get the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“beadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nfrom, the former praying tool of wooden, or glass balls clad\non a piece of string, now widely used to describe a lustful\nactivity.\n\nThis wordbook gives the meaning and the uses of each word.\nIn order to understand the meaning of sex-words we have to\ndig deeper into the old English world of words. This wordbook\nis a path to the old, partly forgotten, history of old English\nlanguage and its origin.\n\nIn this research we have found an old Fruitfulness culture\nabout 5.000 years old that was spread along the Atlantic\ncoast and Scandinavia. These rituals and traditions, concepts,\nand thoughts still influence us today, for example,\nwhen we open a, - pornsite.\n\nThis wordbook is also a way to find the roots to your name,\nthe place where you live, or grew up, because many of the\ntodayÃ‚Â´s place names come from this Fruitfulness culture. Our\ngiven names and family names come from the place-names.\nThe place-names we have come from rituals and traditions.\n\nYes, it is dirty, but by reading this book you are helping the\nold fruitfulness culture to survive. Every time you look at a\nporno-site you perform a holy act, as long as you breed and\nkeep the memory and the culture alive by giving birth to new\ngenerations\n--------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ebb684a76a042f779065cba63beef6121bb58ad","amp;dn":"Old+English+Wordbook+of+Sex+-+Digital+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ebb684a76a042f779065cba63beef6121bb58ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,187,104,74,118,160,66,247,121,6,92,186,99,190,239,97,33,187,88,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

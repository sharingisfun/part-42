In this workshop, creative technologist and trainer Robert Turrall teaches you how to apply your programming knowledge to creating apps; the course assumes that you will have a basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, but no previous iOS experience is necessary. After learning the basics of Objective-C and Cocoa Touch, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work along with Robert to create a series of increasingly complex apps. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re done, you will feel confident in your ability to build and test iOS apps and ready to get in on the action. \n\nInfo: https://video2brain.com/en/courses/getting-started-with-ios-5\n\nPlease SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5805fbed26c7d63f94b9db1f4c0c1168ad9ad59","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Getting+Started+with+iOS+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5805fbed26c7d63f94b9db1f4c0c1168ad9ad59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,128,95,190,210,108,125,99,249,75,157,177,244,192,193,22,138,217,173,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

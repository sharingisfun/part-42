The Stones delivered a five star performance packed full of hits such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœStart Me UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrown SugarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJumpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jack FlashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMiss YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Only Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœGimme ShelterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDoom And GloomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSympathy For The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as well as one or two surprises.\n- Mick Jagger said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a great gigÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It was beautiful with the sun going down over Hyde Park. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think of a better way celebrate the Rolling StonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 50 than doing it on our home patch in front of 100,000 people on a glorious summer nightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦enjoy itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ we certainly did.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n- Keith Richards commented: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coming back to Hyde Park was like a full circle being drawn, and the band were in top form. We thought what could be more appropriate than having a great summer in London!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n- From the second the Rolling Stones stepped out onto the stage each night, through to the dazzling firework and pyrotechnic display that heralded the end of the concert, fans old and new were treated to a non-stop, hit after hit performance, which took them through the StonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ huge back catalogue. Keith Richards wowed the crowds by weaving his charismatic guitar licks with Ronnie WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immense solos, Mick Jagger was on spectacular form, his boundless energy on stage matched by a number of stunning outfit changes, and Charlie Watts the unflappable heartbeat of the band, driving the band on through the set.\n- Former guitarist Mick Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose live debut with the Stones took place at the original 1969 Hyde Park concert Ã¢â‚¬â€œ joined the band on stage to guest on the bluesy Ã¢â‚¬ËœMidnight RamblerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and on closing track Ã¢â‚¬ËœSatisfactionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, whilst long-term live band members Lisa Fischer, Darryl Jones, Chuck Leavell, Bernard Fowler, Bobby Keys and Tim Ries all added their inimitable flair and finesse.\n- The Rolling Stones Sweet Summer Sun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hyde Park Live is the perfect way for concert-goers to relive their favourite memories from the gigs, and for their fans to see the band back where they truly belong: live on the stage in their hometown.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08b10e2386337d322fd836ba1722740ce5fbf75","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones-Sweet+Summer+Sun%3AHyde+Park+Live+%28Blu-ray%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08b10e2386337d322fd836ba1722740ce5fbf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,139,16,226,56,99,55,211,34,253,131,107,161,114,39,64,206,95,191,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

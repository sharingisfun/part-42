To run it you will have to use win 9x compatibility and 256 colors (I recommand 640x480 also)\n\nYou can get rid of usig the CD by copying the entire CD in the installed path\n\nGame desc :\nThis is a game where it fits in all the genres of Strategy, Action. You can take control of one of 4 veichles, a jeep, helicopter, tank and a missle launching vehicle (but actually called The Armoured Support Vehicle (ASV)). While there are 2 ways to win, the easier one would be to capture the enemy&amp;#039;s flag by bringing it to your bunker with the frail Jeep. And that is the main objective.

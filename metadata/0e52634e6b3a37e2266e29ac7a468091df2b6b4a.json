To be more exact it is a story of an elderly couple who take a look back in their life.\n\nThis is a five book series originally published independently in Finnish by Tommi Musturi. To date I believe only the first three have been published in English and I only have the first two ready to share at the moment.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tommi-musturis-last-book-of-hope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tommi-musturis-last-book-of-hope&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e52634e6b3a37e2266e29ac7a468091df2b6b4a","amp;dn":"Tommi+Musturi+The+First+Book+of+Hope+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e52634e6b3a37e2266e29ac7a468091df2b6b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,82,99,78,107,58,55,226,38,110,41,172,122,70,128,145,223,43,107,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

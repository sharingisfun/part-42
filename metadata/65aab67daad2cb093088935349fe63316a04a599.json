And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were â€œthe enemy.â€ If fifteen nationalities could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. That spirit is what Garan calls the â€œorbital perspective.â€\r\n\r\nGaran vividly conveys what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, he describes how he and others are working to apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This book is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth. You don't need to be an astronaut to have the orbital perspective. Garan's message of elevated empathy is an inspiration to all who seek a better world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65aab67daad2cb093088935349fe63316a04a599","amp;dn":"The+Orbital+Perspective+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65aab67daad2cb093088935349fe63316a04a599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,170,182,125,170,210,203,9,48,136,147,83,73,254,99,49,106,4,165,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

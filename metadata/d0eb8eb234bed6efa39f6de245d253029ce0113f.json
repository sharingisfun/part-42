They conquered. They looked fabulous. This wonderfully inventive, visually stunning and incomparably funny Australian import about three drag queen performers braving the vast, rugged outback won the 1994 Academy Award for Costume Design. Veteran actor Terence Stamp (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace), Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) and Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) all give hilarious -and heartfelt- performances in a three-fishes-outta-water story thats &quot;one of the wildest movies ever made&quot; (Rex Reed, New York Observer)! With a contract to perform a drag show way out in the Australian desert, Tick (Weaving), Adam (Pearce) and Ralph (Stamp) each has his own reason for wanting to leave the safety of Sydney. Christening their battered pink tour bus &quot;Priscilla,&quot; this wickedly funny and high drama trio head for the outback... and into crazy adventures in even crazier outfits.

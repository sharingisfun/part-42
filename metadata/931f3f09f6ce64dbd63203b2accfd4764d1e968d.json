It focuses on a rather small area, populated by human and kitsune. It includes conversions of the core classes to a feudal Japanese setting, as well as a new class, and of course kitsune as a player race. There is quite a bit of focus, and game mechanics, on prestige and court politics. Both amongst kitsune, with tricks being a way to build your renown, and the human courts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:931f3f09f6ce64dbd63203b2accfd4764d1e968d","amp;dn":"Kitsunemori+-+D20+Campaign+Setting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"931f3f09f6ce64dbd63203b2accfd4764d1e968d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,31,63,9,246,206,100,219,214,50,3,178,172,207,212,118,77,30,150,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

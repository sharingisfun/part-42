While her longtime lover, SÃƒÂ¸renÃ¢â‚¬â€whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruinÃ¢â‚¬â€is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora's lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury.\n\nHer host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora's protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends.\n\nBut while her flesh is willing, Nora's mind is wandering. To thoughts of SÃƒÂ¸ren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora's past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It's a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105fb05dae020e18ed8b6acee7cd8d6e22762cc5","amp;dn":"The+Angel+-+Tiffany+Reisz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105fb05dae020e18ed8b6acee7cd8d6e22762cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,95,176,93,174,2,14,24,237,139,106,206,231,205,141,110,34,118,44,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

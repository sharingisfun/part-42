You are a &quot;gear&quot; pilot for one of these sides as you join the battle for supremacy. You pilot the various Heavy Gears (large bipedal fighting robots) in a variety of missions, either playing through the storyline for both factions or participating in the endless dynamic war going on between the two. As you get promoted you gain acces to better gears and more destructive weaponry to acomplish your goals.\n\nBonus content: manual, quick reference card, soundtrack, patch.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Download the game;\n2) Mount or burn disc images;\n3) Run Setup.exe to install (it will start automatically if autorun is enabled);\n4) After installation is complete, run hgp187d.exe to patch the game;\n5) Launch the game from the main executable or using the desktop &amp; start menu shortcuts (keep the second disc inserted, I could not find a working no-cd fix).\n\nWarning! This is a really old game. I could not get it working on Windows 7 x64, but I did play it using VMware with Windows XP SP3. It probably won't work on Vista, either. You should get a copy of Windows XP or earlier versions of Windows and use those (either with a virtual machine like I did, or by actually installing them alongside your current OS) to play the game.\n\nIf you like the game, SUPPORT the producer! I don't think you can find copies of this game anymore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03acba4ac82f1a527711f91e6ddb87437742c553","amp;dn":"Heavy+Gear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03acba4ac82f1a527711f91e6ddb87437742c553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,172,186,74,200,47,26,82,119,17,249,30,109,219,135,67,119,66,197,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

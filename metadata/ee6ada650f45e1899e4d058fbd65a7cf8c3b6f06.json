They forever changed the character of America politically, socially, culturally, and economically. Sometimes the changes brought about by these events were obvious; sometimes they were more subtle. Sometimes the effects of these turning points were immediate; other times, their aftershocks reverberated for decades.\n\nRegardless, these great historical turning points demand to be understood.

These 48 lectures, delivered by masterful historian and dynamic Professor Edward T. O'Donnell of College of the Holy Cross, offer you a different perspective on the sweeping narrative of U. S. history. Spanning the arrival of the first English colonists to the chaos of the Civil War to the birth of the computer age and beyond, this course is a captivating and comprehensive tour of those particular moments in the story of America, after which the nation would never be the same again.\n\nEncounter Recurring Themes in American History\nProfessor O'Donnell has selected these specific historical turning points based on his expansive knowledge of American history and his decades of experience as a professor and lecturer to a wide variety of audiences. What makes these specific events turning points, regardless of the form they take, is the fact that they signal times when American society made a break with its past and entered a new phase of development.\n\n&quot;Turning points mark decisive 'before and after' moments in history,&quot; he says at the start of his course. &quot;Before Shays's Rebellion, for example, Americans lived under the Articles of Confederation. After Shays's Rebellion and the constitutional convention it inspired, Americans lived under a new federal government and enjoyed the protections articulated in the Bill of Rights. Put another way, America became a very different place after this event.&quot;\n\nThroughout Turning Points in American History, you'll encounter a series of recurring themes that will put your understanding of U. S. historyÃ¢â‚¬â€and even history itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€into a larger, more informed context. Some of these themes are these:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSurprises: Few people in any historical era are prepared for what's coming, whether it's a war, an epidemic, a revolution, or an invention. Who, 20 years ago, could have expected the astonishing impact of the personal computer on everyday life in America?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAgency: History is often made by towering figures like George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. But it's also made by many nameless and faceless peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€slaves, workers, farmers, suffragistsÃ¢â‚¬â€who take matters into their own hands and achieve historical change.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCrisis: Historical crises are, more often than not, opportunities for great change. American history is filled with moments when a terrible crisisÃ¢â‚¬â€such as the Civil War or the Great DepressionÃ¢â‚¬â€led to a sudden and radical change for the better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee6ada650f45e1899e4d058fbd65a7cf8c3b6f06","amp;dn":"TTC+Audio+-+Turning+Points+in+American+History+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee6ada650f45e1899e4d058fbd65a7cf8c3b6f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,106,218,101,15,69,225,137,158,77,5,143,189,101,167,207,140,59,111,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Foreigner has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide. (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nAlthough punk rock's furious revolution threatened to overthrow rock's old guard in 1977, bands like Foreigner came along and proved that there was plenty of room in the marketplace for both the violent, upstart minimalism of punk and the airbrushed slickness of what would be called 'arena rock.' Along with Boston, Journey, Heart, and others, Foreigner celebrated professionalism over raw emotion. And, looking back, it's easy to see why they sold millions - not everyone in the world was pissed off, dissatisfied with the economy, or even necessarily looking for a change. In fact, for most suburban American teens, Foreigner's immaculate rock sound was the perfect soundtrack for cruising through well-manicured neighborhoods in their Chevy Novas. Foreigner was as good as it got in the late '70s.\n(Review by Andy Hinds, Allmusic.com)\n\n- - -\n\nForeigner - Original Album Series 1977-1984\n(5CD Rhino / Warner Music 2009)\n\nCD1 Foreigner - Foreigner 1977\nCD2 Foreigner - Double Vision 1978\nCD3 Foreigner - Head Games 1979\nCD4 Foreigner - 4 1981\nCD5 Foreigner - Agent Provocateur 1984\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f36b29cd68a09bc83b3c15655d476bdc56acfb","amp;dn":"Foreigner+-+Original+Album+Series+-+5CD-BOX+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f36b29cd68a09bc83b3c15655d476bdc56acfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,243,107,41,205,104,160,155,200,59,60,21,101,93,71,107,220,86,172,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

From first to last I loved this wise and irreverent novel.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Margot Livesey\n\n&quot;I always feel in her work such a sense of toughness and humorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Her writing is sad and funny, and that makes it more of both.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Jennifer Egan\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lore Segal is a marvelous and fearless writer. No subject is too hard, too absurd, or too painful for her wise, peculiar and brilliant fiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Lily Tuck\n\nThe renowned New Yorker writer and Pulitzer Prize finalist Lore SegalÃ¢â‚¬â€whom The New York Times declared &quot;closer than anyone to writing the Great American Novel&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€delivers a hilarious, poignant and profoundly moving tale of living, loving and aging in America today.\n\nAt Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, doctors have noticed a marked uptick in Alzheimer's patients. People who seemed perfectly lucid just a day earlier suddenly show signs of advanced dementia. Is it just normal aging, or an epidemic? Is it a coincidence, or a secret terrorist plot?\n\nIn the looking-glass world of Half the KingdomÃ¢â‚¬â€where terrorist paranoia and end-of-the-world hysteria mask deeper fears of mortality; where parents' and their grown children's feelings vacillate between frustration and tenderness; and where the broken medical system leads one character to quip, &quot;Kafka wrote slice-of-life fiction&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€all is familiar and yet slightly askew.\n\nLore Segal masterfully interweaves her characters' livesÃ¢â‚¬â€lives that, for good or for ill, all converge in Cedar's ERÃ¢â‚¬â€into a funny, tragic, and tender portrait of how we live today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5872251f604df968c91b009f053be05c69bf5046","amp;dn":"Half+the+Kingdom+-+Lore+Segal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5872251f604df968c91b009f053be05c69bf5046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,114,37,31,96,77,249,104,201,27,0,159,5,59,224,92,105,191,80,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

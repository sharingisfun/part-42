They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continue to tour across Canada.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLights from the Valley is the seventh album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in the summer of 1978; the album marked the recording debut of Brian MacLeod with the band.\n\nIntended to consolidate the success of the precedent Dreams, Dreams, Dreams album, Lights from the Valley was somewhat of a disappointment, the financial problems at Mushroom Records due to litigation with the rock band Heart causing Lights from the Valley to be underpromoted.\n\nThe album's title derives from the lyrics of its lead single &quot;Arms of Mary&quot;, the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver song being the first outside material Chilliwack had recorded since the outfit had changed their name from the Collectors in 1970. &quot;Arms of Mary&quot; became the fourth single by Chilliwack to reach the Billboard Hot 100 but like the band's precedent Hot 100 entrants it failed to become a major hit peaking at #67. Chilliwack would subsequently be absent from the Hot 100 for three years until the autumn of 1981 when the band would score its US Top 40 breakthrough with &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBill Henderson: guitar, vocals\n\nGlenn Miller: bass, vocals\n\nRoss Turney: drums, percussion\n\nHoward Froese: guitar, vocals\n\nBrian MacLeod: guitars, vocals\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8ef8f4dcacbffbda8cf4f1366e8dee77ac58f5","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Lights+From+The+Valley+%5B1978%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8ef8f4dcacbffbda8cf4f1366e8dee77ac58f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,142,248,244,220,172,191,251,218,140,244,241,54,110,141,238,119,172,88,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

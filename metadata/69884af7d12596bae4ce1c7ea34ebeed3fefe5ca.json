After discovering a cache of Prothean technology on Mars in 2148, humanity is spreading to the stars; the newest interstellar species, struggling to carve out its place in the greater galactic community.\n\nOn the edge of colonized space, ship commander and Alliance war hero David Anderson investigates the remains of a top secret military research station; smoking ruins littered with bodies and unanswered questions. Who attacked this post and for what purpose? And where is Kahlee Sanders, the young scientist who mysteriously vanished from the base - hours before her colleagues were slaughtered?\n\nSanders is now the prime suspect, but finding her creates more problems for Anderson than it solves. Partnered with a rogue alien agent he can't trust and pursued by an assassin he can't escape, Anderson battles impossible odds on uncharted worlds to uncover a sinister conspiracy . . . one he won't live to tell about. Or so the enemy thinks.\n\n\n\n[b][i]Mass Effect: Ascension[/i][/b]\n[img]http://masseffect.bioware.com/resources/assets/market/books/ascension-t.png[/img]\n\nWhen they vanished fifty thousand years ago, the Protheans left their advanced technology scattered throughout the galaxy. The chance discovery of a Prothean cache on Mars allows humanity to join those already reaping the rewards of the ancients' high-tech wizardry. But for one rogue militia, the goal is not participation but domination.\n\nScientist Kahlee Sanders has left the Systems Alliance for the Ascension Project, a program that helps gifted &quot;biotic&quot; children harness their extraordinary powers. The program's most promising student is twelve-year-old Gillian Grayson, who is borderline autistic. What Kahlee doesn't know is that Gillian is an unwitting pawn of the outlawed black ops group Cerberus, which is sabotaging the program by conducting illegal experiments on the students.\n\nWhen the Cerberus plot is exposed, Gillian's father takes her away from the Ascension Project and flees into the lawless Terminus Systems. Determined to protect Gillian, Kahlee goes with them... unaware that the elder Grayson is, in fact, a Cerberus operative. To rescue the young girl Kahlee must travel to the farthest ends of the galaxy, battling fierce enemies and impossible odds. But how will she be able to save a daughter from her own father?\n\n\n\n[b][i]Mass Effect: Retribution[/i][/b]\n[img]http://masseffect.bioware.com/resources/assets/market/books/retribution-t.png[/img]\n\nRetribution is set in the universe fans know well from the video game and novel seriesÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69884af7d12596bae4ce1c7ea34ebeed3fefe5ca","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+Novels%2BComics+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69884af7d12596bae4ce1c7ea34ebeed3fefe5ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,136,74,247,209,37,150,186,228,206,28,126,163,78,190,237,63,239,229,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

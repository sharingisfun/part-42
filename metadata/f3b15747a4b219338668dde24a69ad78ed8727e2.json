Can you imagine goats injected with a spider gene so they produce silk in their milk? How about a macaque giving another monkey CPR after it was electrocuted on an Indian railway? Birds that were mysteriously burnt alive mid-flight? \r\nChris Packham (looking very Reservoir Dogs in his shades and suit as he strides around the desert) links footage of some truly bizarre events, which may turn your stomach as well as make your jaw drop. The pulsating crimson blob discovered in a sewer is revolting, whereas siphonophores (no, I hadn't heard of them either) look like exquisite glass sculptures even though the way they grow is odd.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nFrom the team who brought you Nature's Weirdest Events comes a new series exploring the unexplained, the unexpected and the unidentifiable. Chris Packham unlocks the secrets behind the world's weirdest events from a bird-killing solar death ray to a monkey that's learnt first aid.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nFrom his base in an abandoned town in the Nevada desert, Chris Packham explores fascinatingly bizarre stories from around the world.

In this episode, Chris unearths a whirlwind wedding ceremony, some exploding rocks, and a woman with her twin inside her brain.\r\n\r\n5)  Part 5 \r\nOur weird world throws up more surprises for Chris Packham. In this episode, Chris reveals how deadly poisonous frogs can saves lives, why we see faces in everything and how one woman's pants spontaneously burst into flame.\r\n\r\n6)  Part 6 \r\nThe world has gone weird for Chris Packham.

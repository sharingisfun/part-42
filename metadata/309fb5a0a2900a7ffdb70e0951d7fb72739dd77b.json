So when he gets called into a disciplinary meeting, he genuinely fears for his job. He's terrified. He gets a final written warning, last chance.\n\nAs sole breadwinner, he knows his family will go under if he loses his job, so when he oversleeps again, desperation leads him to tell an incredible lie that grows out of his control.\n\n=====================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 332MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 703Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n=====================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309fb5a0a2900a7ffdb70e0951d7fb72739dd77b","amp;dn":"Ordinary+Lies+S01E01+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309fb5a0a2900a7ffdb70e0951d7fb72739dd77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,159,181,160,162,144,10,127,253,183,14,9,81,215,251,114,115,157,215,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

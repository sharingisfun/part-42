Sarah is struggling to come to terms with her husband's recent suicide and the stubborn behavior of her four-year-old son, who is convinced that he really is Batman.\nThe tenuous friendship between Sarah and Little Bee that grows, is challenged, and ultimately endures is the heart of this emotional, tense, and often hilarious novel.\n\nConsidered by some to be the next Kite Runner, Little Bee is an achingly human story set against the inhuman realities of war-torn Africa. Wrenching tests of friendship and terrible moral dilemmas fuel this irresistible novel.\n\n\nNumber of CD: 9 CD\nRead by: Anne Flosnik\nPlay time: 11 hours unabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16145893bec3db2b5223e6881ea81be6a061e322","amp;dn":"Chris+Cleave+-+Little+Bee+-+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16145893bec3db2b5223e6881ea81be6a061e322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,20,88,147,190,195,219,43,82,35,230,136,30,168,27,230,160,97,227,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It spawned the 2 Tone music and cultural movement, which was popular among skinheads, rudies and some mod revivalists. The label stopped operating when The Specials split in 1985. 2 Tone Records signed The Selecter, Madness and The Beat, but they all left within two years. 2 Tone Records acts signed a contract that allowed them to leave the label after releasing just one single, which was unusual in the record industry. Madness and The Beat both took advantage of this clause; the former to sign to Stiff Records, and the latter to start their own label, Go Feet Records.\n\nAlthough 2 Tone Records was closely identified with the ska revival, efforts were made to broaden the label&amp;#039;s musical output, releasing recordings by artists such as singer-songwriter Elvis Costello and the funk-punk band The Higsons. Two bands that almost made it onto the label were UB40 and Dexys Midnight Runners.\n\nJerry Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter, created artwork that was to become central to 2 Tone Records. The Walt Jabsco logo portrays a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers. The fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of The Wailers\n\n\nTHE COMPACT 2 TONE STORY\n\nThis 4 CD box set collects the A-side and B-side of every single released on the label. Both sides of the Dutch Concrete Jungle single plus both tracks from the free single which accompanied initial copies of More Specials are also included. The Bodysnatchers live version of 007 is the only unreleased track in the set, however it did previously appear in the film Dance Craze but failed to make it on to the films soundtrack album.\n\nJerry Dammers was less than impressed with its release and had this to say about it: &quot;It&amp;#039;s real train spotters stuff with every B-side from every free single and I wasn&amp;#039;t even consulted about it. In some ways that (The Compact 2 Tone Story) is the worst.&quot; (Uncut Magazine interview 1998).\n\nEach of the CDs comes in its own mini 2 Tone sleeve and an A5 version of George Marshalls book The Two Tone Story is also included.\n\nTwo Tone was the UK&amp;#039;s most exciting new musical movement at the start of the 80s. Groups like Madness, The Selecter, The (English) Beat and The Special AKA, all on the Two Tone label, revived the Jamaican ska beat and created a new urgent sound that took youth culture by storm.\n\n\n(Disc 1)\n                                                                                           \n01.

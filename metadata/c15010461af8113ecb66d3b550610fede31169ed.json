It was released June 29, 2004.\n\nThe album featured the single &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot;. This album is considered one of their best later works and became one of the top selling albums of the year in Canada. It also helped to re-establish the band&amp;#039;s older musical style. The album was recorded at Studio X in Seattle.\n\nOne of the major themes of this album is the response to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with overtly political anti-war themes throughout the album. In the poignant &quot;Are We Family&quot;, Gordon Downie questions the logic of &quot;taking care of each other one bullet to another&quot;, while &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot; likens the collapse of the rationale of the war to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.\n\n&quot;Gus: The Polar Bear From Central Park&quot; is a metaphor comparing George W. Bush to the famously depressed polar bear in the Central Park Zoo who is &quot;too either them or me&quot;, and speculates that the cause of the problem is that &quot;no one is afraid enough&quot;. &quot;Heaven Is a Better Place Today&quot; doubles as a tribute to hockey player Dan Snyder and, as Downie would reveal, for young men being sent to war.\n\nHowever, aside from this last comment regarding &quot;Heaven...&quot; (which is not cited), much of this analysis is purely speculative.\n\nAll songs were written by The Tragically Hip.\n\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n&quot;Vaccination Scar&quot; \n&quot;It Can&amp;#039;t Be Nashville Every Night&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15010461af8113ecb66d3b550610fede31169ed","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+2004+-+In+Between+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15010461af8113ecb66d3b550610fede31169ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,80,16,70,26,248,17,62,203,102,211,181,80,97,15,237,227,17,105,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

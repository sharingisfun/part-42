If you're looking for a serious film, \nlook elsewhere. However, if you're looking for some action, a lot of laughs, and a tongue in cheek\nvariation on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. Everyone chews the scenery a bit,\nbut that's really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny. \nDonald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.\n\n* A funny and entertaining movie, 21 September 2005 \n* 9/10\n* Author: hicklebookworm from United States\n\nLove the characters and the story line. Very funny with plenty of action. \nThomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. \nI enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. \nDonald Southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt out hit man. \nAll three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat. \nA nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. \nIf you like... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, \nThe Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards... you will love this movie. \n\n* Difference makes the difference, 27 August 2003\n* 10/10\n* Author: Mr_Movies from U.S.\n\nThis is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. \nAll of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough \nto grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real \nlife and &quot;ficticious&quot; action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, \nit has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. \nName me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing \na song like &quot;They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars.&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcdeb6d622d85910a005267536c7101d355a17a","amp;dn":"Hollow.Point.%281995%29.DVDRip.XViD-SFCR.SvcdPlaza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcdeb6d622d85910a005267536c7101d355a17a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,205,235,109,98,45,133,145,10,0,82,103,83,108,113,1,211,85,161,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

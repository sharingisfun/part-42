It has been well over a year since I've listened to any Chants, and I will defiantly be playing this one again in the days to come.  If you've not heard other Chants before, do a search on &quot;chants discography&quot; here on The Pirate Bay.  You will find a 14 album compilation I shared back in early 2012 spanning releases from 1987 through to 2010.\n\nI've also checked out the &quot;Beckah Shae - Turbo Style - Single&quot; earlier this week.  I believe it was officially released back in July sometime.  If you're a Beckah Shae fan, and have not yet heard it, be sure to download it and put it on your &quot;must listen to&quot; list.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not a big metalcore/hardcore fan.  But I listened to most of &quot;Mouth Of The South - Transparency&quot; yesterday, and once I got past the intensity of the music itself (although I'm not sure if I ever did, hahaha), the lyrical message was quite moving.  It plays right into the type of person I am.  True to my faith, true to the Lord.  People who pose as Believers, pretenders in their faith, yet do nothing to allow the Holy Spirit to dwell and thrive within them are only lying to themselves.  God, and even some us true Believers, can see right through it!  I can't begin to tell you how many people I've told &quot;I want to be transparent to others, just as I am to God&quot; this past year alone.  So when I saw a title called &quot;Transparency&quot; by some Hardcore Christian group I've never heard of (gasp) I had to put it on my own &quot;must listen to&quot; list.\n\nAnd finally I also had a chance to check out &quot;Sean Michel - Electric Delta&quot; earlier this week.  Apparently this is Sean's second release, but his first big time presence.  His blues / southern rock style certainly didn't disappoint me.  Hopefully it will find a nice home in your collection too.\n\nWith that said, rarely do I listen to the stuff I download.  I make it no secret that I do this for the Lord's glory, not for my own enjoyment.  But if someone downloads any albums within this bundle (or any other bundles for that matter) please do us all a favor, come back, and post a quick message in the thread telling us which albums you particularly enjoyed.  Your message just might be an encouragement to others, and a service to God.\n\nBundle 32 includes the following 23 releases.

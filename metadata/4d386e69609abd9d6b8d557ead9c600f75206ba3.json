The following year (1991) recorded a demo that would become a 7&quot;EP for Drowned Prod. property of Dave Rotten (current owner of Xtreem Music and vocalist in Avulsed), following the same path of their previous demo. The EP &quot;Crown Waits the Immortal&quot; saw the light in September of that year in a limited edition of 500 copies. Dave, happy with the band, made an offer to them for their first full length, which the group gladly accepted, as he pretty well sold this EP and not only because of the promotion it meant, but also because of the quality of band and their compositions. \r\n\r\nNow the band ready to become a bigger act (and possibly less valued in his time!), entered MDM Studios to record and mix &quot;Member of Immortal Damnation&quot;, still today being considered one of the best finnish Death Metal albums of early 90â€™s, with cover made by great genius of the pencil and oil Chris Moyen (Nominon, Incantation, etc ...) dark and blasphemous as few rarely been seen with a promising future and a couple of good jobs to cut through the wave of groups of that time. After this album, the band decided to separate, due to musical differences (including his guitarist Toni Honcala determined to pay more attention to his side-band parallel Cough). \r\nIn 2010, US label Dark Symphonies did a supposedly limited edition (which later resulted it wasnâ€™t. It was just a trick) of the album, EP and demo in a double vinyl edition, being followed in 2011 by a CD re-issue through Xtreem Music. This same year, PURTENANCE decided to reform as a trio with original members Juha Rannikko (guitars) and Harri Salo (drums) plus new member Ville Koskela on bass &amp; vocal duties. They started to write new material and a new mini CD came out in summer 2012 entitled â€œSacrifice the Kingâ€, again with Chris Moyen artwork and receiving a big welcome from the scene. \r\n\r\nHowever, this EP got mixed feelings amongst fans, but this didnâ€™t stop the band which not only continued working on new songs, but also added a second guitarist called Ville Nokkelainen and started to play their first shows after 20 years at the same time they were recording their long awaited second album â€Awaken From Slumberâ€ released in October 2013 through Xtreem Music coinciding with the very first show of the band outside of Finland at the Ritual Zombi Fest in Madrid (Spain). â€œAwaken From Slumberâ€ shows the heaviest and darkest side of PURTENANCE ever, this time getting an awesome acceptation amongst their followers!!\r\n(Xtreemmusic)\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 1991 - 2015\r\nCountry: Finland\r\nGenre: Death Metal\r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: Various\r\nSize: 338 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n1991 - Crown Waits the Immortal (EP)\r\n1992 - Member of Immortal Damnation (Full-length)\r\n2012 - Sacrifice The King (EP)\r\n2013 - Awaken From Slumber (Full-length)\r\n2015 - ...To Spread The Flame Of Ancients (Full-length)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d386e69609abd9d6b8d557ead9c600f75206ba3","amp;dn":"Purtenance+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%281991+-+2015%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d386e69609abd9d6b8d557ead9c600f75206ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,56,110,105,96,154,189,157,107,141,85,126,173,156,96,15,117,32,107,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

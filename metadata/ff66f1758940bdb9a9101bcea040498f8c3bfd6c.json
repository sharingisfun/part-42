It is extremely corny and this is not diminished in any way by the cutting-edge 1993 special effects that suggest a low budget was the key factor.  It is good for a laugh if you are a roleplayer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff66f1758940bdb9a9101bcea040498f8c3bfd6c","amp;dn":"Dragon+Strike+VHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff66f1758940bdb9a9101bcea040498f8c3bfd6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,102,241,117,137,64,189,185,169,16,27,206,160,64,73,143,140,59,253,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

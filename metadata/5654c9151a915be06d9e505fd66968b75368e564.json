Ironically, WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful recording for Modern was his re-working of Earl KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Orleans-flavored Those Lonely Lonely Nights.\n\n&quot;Then there was AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Gonna Hush, practically as wild and woolly as his feedback breakthrough Space Guitar. Motorhead Baby (recently covered by Jimmie Vaughan) is a souped-up version of the version he'd recorded on Federal.&quot;\nLivinBlues.com\n\nA seminal influence on the next generation of electric guitarists - including Hendrix, Johnny Guitar Watson pioneered the use of feedback and had an attack that was second to none. His lacerating fretwork is all over these late 50s cuts.\n\nFrank Zappa stated that &quot;Watson's 1956 song Three Hours Past Midnight inspired me to become a guitarist&quot;. Zappa also often named &quot;Three Hours Past Midnight&quot; as his favorite record. When Zappa's family heard that Lou Reed would be inducting Zappa in the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, they suggested Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson as a better choice.\n\nJimmie Vaughan, brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan, is quoted as saying: &quot;When my brother Stevie and I were growing up in Dallas, we idolized very few guitarists. We were highly selective and highly critical. Johnny 'Guitar' Watson was at the top of the list, along with Freddie, Albert and B.B. King. He made magic.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ignore all the compilations and &quot;Best of Johnny's&quot;, because Gangster of Love and 3 Hours Past Midnight are your definitive recordings.\n\n&quot;Johnny Guitar Watson smoked 'em out of the hall every time he picked up a guitar. You can hear Johnny's licks in most rock and blues played after this, but he played with style.\n\n&quot;I'm not a big fan of the 70's funk scene that he took part in, but his blues and rock &amp; roll are all-time hits. It's all right here.&quot;\nAmazon review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5654c9151a915be06d9e505fd66968b75368e564","amp;dn":"Johnny+Guitar+Watson+-+3+Hours+Past+Midnight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5654c9151a915be06d9e505fd66968b75368e564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,84,201,21,26,145,91,224,109,158,80,95,214,105,104,183,83,104,229,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

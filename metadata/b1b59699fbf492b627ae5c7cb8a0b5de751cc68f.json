We're just a bunch of &quot;gun nuts&quot; like you who can speak and write fairly good English, and when we test and review guns and hunting products, we present the results in a straightforward, no-nonsense format that provides all the information you need to make a purchase decisionÃ¢â‚¬â€including the price.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b59699fbf492b627ae5c7cb8a0b5de751cc68f","amp;dn":"ON+Target+Magazine+-+Tactical+Issue+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b59699fbf492b627ae5c7cb8a0b5de751cc68f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,181,150,153,251,244,146,182,39,174,92,124,184,160,181,222,117,28,198,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

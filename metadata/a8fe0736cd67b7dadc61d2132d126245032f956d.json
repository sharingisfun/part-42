Born in Portland, Oregon and raised in Corvallis, Oregon, he spent two years of his childhood growing up in Italy. His earliest musical influence was his mother, a classically trained pianist and part-time piano teacher.\n\nHe plays a Martin Committee Handcraft trumpet made in 1940, and uses a 3 silver plated mouthpiece from Bach made in 1926, having recently retired his 1920 3C Bach mouthpiece. He counts Miles Davis among his most significant influences.\n\nBotti attended Mount Hood Community College in Gresham, Oregon where he studied under Larry McVey whose renowned jazz program had come to be a regular stop for Stan Kenton and Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© when they were looking for new players. It was here he played alongside his friend, trombonist and future Academy Award nominated filmmaker, Todd Field.\n\nAfter leaving Mount Hood, Botti studied under David Baker and Bill Adam at Indiana University. Botti also studied with Fred Sautter, a Claude Gordon student.\n\n    * First Wish (1995)\n    * Midnight Without You (1997)\n    * Slowing Down the World (1999)\n    * Night Sessions (2001)\n    * The Very Best of Chris Botti (2002)\n    * December (2002)\n    * A Thousand Kisses Deep (2003)\n    * When I Fall In Love (2004)\n    * To Love Again (2005)\n    * Live: With Orchestra and Special Guests (2006)\n    * Italia (2007)\n    * Chris Botti in Boston (2009)\n\nI have included A Thousand Kisses Deep and To Love Again (The Duets)\n\n[img]http://bayimg.com/kApfaaaba[/img]\nTo Love Again (The Duets)\n\n   1. &quot;Embraceable You&quot;\n   2. &quot;What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?&quot; (featuring Sting)\n   3. &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; (featuring Paula Cole)\n   4. &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; (featuring Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©)\n   5. &quot;What's New?&quot;\n   6. &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot; (featuring Jill Scott)\n   7. &quot;To Love Again&quot;\n   8. &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot; (featuring Paul Buchanan)\n   9. &quot;Lover Man&quot; (featuring Gladys Knight)\n  10. &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot;\n  11. &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (featuring Renee Olstead)\n  12. &quot;Here's That Rainy Day&quot; (featuring Rosa Passos)\n  13. &quot;Smile&quot; (featuring Steven Tyler)\n\n[img]http://bayimg.com/JApfpAaba[/img]\n\nA Thousand Kisses Deep\n\n1.\tIndian Summer\n2.\tDo It in Luxury\n3.\tLook of Love, The  \n4.\tA Thousand Kisses Deep  \n5.\tEver Since We Met\n6.\tBack Into My Heart\n7.\tMy Funny Valentine\n8.\tLast Three Minutes, The\n9.\tIf I Could\n10.\tShe Comes From Somewhere\n11.\tLove Gets Old\n\nSeed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8fe0736cd67b7dadc61d2132d126245032f956d","amp;dn":"Chris+Botti+%28FLAC%29+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8fe0736cd67b7dadc61d2132d126245032f956d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,254,7,54,205,103,183,218,220,97,210,19,45,18,98,69,3,47,149,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

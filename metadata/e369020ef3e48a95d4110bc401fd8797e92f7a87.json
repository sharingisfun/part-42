The band was named after a character from the Lewis Carroll poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Based out of San Francisco, California, the band was active from 1967 to 1969. Their initial three-song EP produced a minor underground hit with the song &quot;Hearts to Cry&quot;. A recording of their live work, titled A Young Man's Song, was released on the Big Beat label.\n\nThe band was formed across the bay from San Francisco in Contra Costa County, and changed personnel several times in their brief lifespan (1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ69). Interest from several record companies came to naught, and the band's only release was a three-song EP on their own label, pressed in a quantity of 1000 and distributed locally.\n\nFour members of Frumious Bandersnatch (Bobby Winkelman, Jack King, Ross Valory, and David Denny) became regular members of the Steve Miller Band. Valory, along with fellow Frumious Bandersnatch member George Tickner and manager Herbie Herbert joined former Santana members Neal Schon and Gregg Rolie to form the band Journey in 1973.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMad River was an American psychedelic rock band.\n\nMad River formed at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio in April 1966. The band took its name from the nearby Mad River. By March 1967 they had relocated to Berkeley, California. There they came to the attention of cult author Richard Brautigan who launched the band into the growing hippie culture. They released an EP on the independent Wee label before signing a contract with Capitol Records in February 1968. The group's lead songwriter was Lawrence Hammond, but all of the members sang vocals. They released two albums before disbanding in July 1969.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes From The Underground was a Berkeley based band from the late 60's.  The band became well known for their music.  They had one full album released in 1968, self-titled.  Seven of their songs appear on &quot;The Berkekey Ep's&quot; album &quot;Nuggets From The Golden State&quot; released in 1995.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e369020ef3e48a95d4110bc401fd8797e92f7a87","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Berkeley+EP%27s+%5B1966-1968%5D%5B1995%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e369020ef3e48a95d4110bc401fd8797e92f7a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,105,2,14,243,228,138,149,212,17,11,196,1,253,135,151,233,47,122,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

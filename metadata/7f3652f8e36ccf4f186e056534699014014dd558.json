Emilio \n\nEstevez stars as Jack Colt, the Mel Gibson-like loose cannon, while Samuel L. Jackson assumes the Danny Glover role as Wes \n\nLuger, his exasperated partner. Together, Colt and Luger investigate the murder of Luger's former partner (Whoopi Goldberg) \n\nand discover a criminal conspiracy led by the nefarious General Mortars (William Shatner). Hoping to mimic the success of the \n\nNaked Gun films, director Gene Quintano (of Police Academy 4 fame) loaded the film with broad visual gags, deadpan slapstick, \n\nand gratuitous parodies of The Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct, and other movies. The attempt to mimic successful \n\nparodies proved ineffective, however, as critics and viewers alike found the parody stale and the juvenile humor dreary.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated PG-13\n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t5 February 1993\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 3015 Kbps Widescreen\n         * Audio - English\n         * Subs  - English\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n\n\n        Uploader Info ***:\n\tThank you for choosing my release from others that are available\n\ton the internet already.

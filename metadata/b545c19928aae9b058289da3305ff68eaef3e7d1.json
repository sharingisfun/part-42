Ohtsu (Springer, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nhis volume focuses on the characterization of nano-optical materials and optical near-field interactions. It begins with the techniques for characterizing the magneto-optical Kerr effect and continues with methods to determine structural and optical properties in high-quality quantum wires with high spatial uniformity. Further topics include: near-field luminescence mapping in InGaN/GaN single quantum well structures in order to interpret the recombination mechanism in InGaN-based nano-structures; and theoretical treatment of the optical near field and optical near-field interactions, providing the basis for investigating the signal transport and associated dissipation in nano-optical devices. Taken as a whole, this overview will be a valuable resource for engineers and scientists working in the field of nano-electro-optics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b545c19928aae9b058289da3305ff68eaef3e7d1","amp;dn":"Progress+in+Nano-Electro+Optics+IV+-+Characterization+of+Nano-Op","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b545c19928aae9b058289da3305ff68eaef3e7d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,69,193,153,40,170,233,176,88,40,157,163,48,95,246,142,174,243,231,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Please seed and share with our friends on TPB!  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nFrom the Volume 1 hardcover description:\n\nCritically acclaimed graphic novelist Garth Ennis and Mike Wolfer unleash an all-new kind of horror as they rip the horrors of war right from today's headlines and thrust it beyond the boundaries of sanity. Three American soldiers, the survivors of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, struggle across the Taliban-controlled mountains. Injured and lacking food, water, and medicine, they discover something far worse than enemy fighters among the sun-bleached rocks: an ancient supernatural power, murderous and unstoppable. Despite a timely rescue by a handful of British S.A.S. commandos, they're still hopelessly outnumbered by the shambling, ragged undead and the evil human intelligence that controls them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1f706c5ec1d015bfe06c0026be0e15fc7f9b2e","amp;dn":"STITCHED+001-013+%28Avatar+Press%29+Up-to-date+thru+April+17%2C+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1f706c5ec1d015bfe06c0026be0e15fc7f9b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,31,112,108,94,193,208,21,191,224,108,0,38,190,14,21,252,127,155,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Thelen (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nProteomics is the large-scale functional analysis of proteins extracted from intact organisms, tissues, individual cells, or cell compartments, at defined timepoints during development or under specific conditions.\r\n\r\nPlant Proteomics highlights the rapid progress in this field in plants, with emphasis on recent work in model plant species, subcellular organelles, and specific aspects of the plant life cycle such as signalling, reproduction and stress physiology. Diverse integrated approaches, including advanced proteomic techniques combined with functional genomics, bioinformatics, metabolomics and molecular cell biology, are presented in several chapters, making this book a valuable resource for a broad spectrum of readers ranging from teachers and advanced students to researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e6fce7ff7cbfcadeb0c99d211c6c1347274d3f","amp;dn":"Plant+Proteomics+-+Jozef+%26Scaron%3Bamaj%2C+Jay+J.+Thelen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e6fce7ff7cbfcadeb0c99d211c6c1347274d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,230,252,231,255,124,191,202,222,176,201,157,33,28,108,19,71,39,77,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

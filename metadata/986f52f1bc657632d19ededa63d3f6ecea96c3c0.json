Born in Lakeland, Florida, and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Evans moved to Los Angeles in 1993 for a career in the music business. After working as a backing vocalist for Al B. Sure, and Christopher Williams, she became the first female artist to be signed to Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment label in 1994, on which she released three platinum-certified studio albums between the years of 1995 and 2001. In 2003, she left the label to sign with Capitol Records.She released one studio album and a christmas compilation on the label before leaving and signing with E1 Entertainment in 2009.\n\nNext to her recording career, Evans is widely known as the widow of New York rapper Christopher &quot;The Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace, whom she married on August 4, 1994, three weeks after meeting at a Bad Boy photoshoot. The turbulent marriage led to Evans' involvement in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud, dominating the rap scene at the time, and ended with Wallace's murder in a yet-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California in March 1997. A 1997 tribute single featuring Puff Daddy and 112, entitled &quot;I'll Be Missing You&quot;, became Evans' biggest-selling hit to date and won her a Grammy Award in 1998.\n\nAlso an avocational actress and writer, Evans made her big screen debut in the 2000 musical drama Turn It Up by Robert Adetuyi. Her self-written autobiography Keep the Faith: A Memoir was released by Grand Central Publishing in 2008 and won a 2009 African American Literary Award for the Best Biography/Memoir category.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:986f52f1bc657632d19ededa63d3f6ecea96c3c0","amp;dn":"Faith+Evans+-+Gone+Already+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"986f52f1bc657632d19ededa63d3f6ecea96c3c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,111,82,241,188,101,118,50,209,158,222,218,99,211,246,236,234,150,195,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The problem is they will only load one page at a time. So if you are viewing a large website with a thousand pages, you&amp;#039;d have to click the mouse a thousand times ... and ... choose a directory/folder a thousands times when you want to save each file. You end up spending a lot of time waiting around and not enough time reading or viewing pages on the Internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d294e9b9b8a5076b9ad971c87e1631567c2e2fb","amp;dn":"Website+eXtractor+9.52+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d294e9b9b8a5076b9ad971c87e1631567c2e2fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,41,78,155,155,138,80,118,185,173,151,28,135,225,99,21,103,194,226,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

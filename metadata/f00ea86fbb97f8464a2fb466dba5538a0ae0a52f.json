It is played while Tuco (Eli Wallach) is frantically searching a graveyard for the grave that holds $200,000 in gold coins, and also during some of the other scenes in the film. The song is played as Tuco and Blondie (Clint Eastwood) are walking through the desert, and additionally over the closing credits. It stands as one of the most well known of Ennio Morricone's themes, and indeed as one of the most famous musical compositions in the history of cinema.\n\nRemixed by Bandini for the Ennio Morricone Remixes 2 album released on February 10, 2004 by Compost Records.

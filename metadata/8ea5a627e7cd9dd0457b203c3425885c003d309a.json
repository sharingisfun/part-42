It was released in August 2009 as the third single from her self-titled second album, and her sixth single release overall.\n\nThe music video, directed by Roman White, debuted on CMT on September 11, 2009. The video begins with Pickler sitting on a bed, before making her way outside to a balcony. She is then shown standing among ruins, and then walking along the beach. The video was shot in the Dominican Republic.\n\n&quot;Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You&quot; is a power ballad, backed primarily by piano and electric guitar. The female narrator describes the feeling of losing the one she loves:\n\n    Didn't you know how much I loved you\n    Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby\n    I gave you everything, every part of me\n    Didn't you feel it when I touched you\n    Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby\n    Baby tell me\n    Didn't you know how much I loved you\n\nThe song was originally featured as a track on Pickler's debut album, Small Town Girl. It was later re-recorded and included on Kellie Pickler, from which it was released as a single at Pickler's request: &quot;I love 'DidnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t You Know How Much I Loved You!' I was gonna put it on every album until it was released as a single. I guess they figure this might finally shut me up.&quot;\n\nKellie Pickler is the self-titled second studio album by country artist Kellie Pickler. The lead-off single, &quot;Don't You Know You're Beautiful&quot; was debuted at the 43rd Academy Of Country Music awards and was a Top 25 hit, peaking at #21. The album was released via BNA Records/19 Recordings on September 30, 2008. The second single, &quot;Best Days Of Your Life&quot; (a song she co-wrote with good friend Taylor Swift, who also provides background vocals), was released in November and became Pickler's first Top 10 hit, peaking at #9. &quot;Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You,&quot; a re-recording from Kellie's debut album Small Town Girl, was released on August 31, 2009 as the third single.\n\n&quot;Lucky Girl&quot; was previously recorded by co-writer Catherine Britt on her third full-length studio album Little Wildflower.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea5a627e7cd9dd0457b203c3425885c003d309a","amp;dn":"Kellie+Pickler-Didn%5C%27t+You+Know+How+Much+I+Loved+You+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea5a627e7cd9dd0457b203c3425885c003d309a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,165,166,39,231,205,157,208,69,123,32,60,52,37,136,92,0,61,48,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

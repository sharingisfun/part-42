I've seen its true face. \nStoryline:In an alternate reality, it's 1985, costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime- fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching The Watchmen?\n\n\nCast: \nMalin Akerman\t ... Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II\nBilly Crudup\t...

Back then they forged their own unique sound by infusing bossa nova with African traditions, jazz instrumentation and the lyrical themes of Samba-CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o [sung samba].\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Call of the GodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ exquisitely captures their self styled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“afro-bossaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sound of the 1960s, conjuring up that golden age Rio de Janeiro feel. The Ipanemas are a direct link to the old samba roots of the street bars in bohemian Lapa, the 1950s Copacabana jazz joints, and the emerging bossa wave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wilson and Neco come from the source and made a sound all their own. Crucially, the album is driven throughout by the deep spiritual kick of the Afro-Brazilian religion and music Candomble, whose Gods inspire the title and so much more - as Wilson says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Brazilian music is religionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. This album swings with grace and pure class, thanks to the rich experience only The Ipanemas can bring. \n\nThe Ipanemas, aka Os Ipanemas are led by Brazilian septuagenarians Wilson Das Neves and Neco. Both have had extraordinary careers spanning five decades as key players at the heart of Brazilian musical history. Wilson Das Neves, now also a vocalist, has long been one of the most sought-after drummers in Brazil and NecoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bossa guitar genius can be traced to countless cult classics. They have recorded and toured with so many greats including Elis Regina, Tom Jobim, Wilson Simonal, Jorge Ben, Chico Buarque and Elza Soares. Wilson also features with RioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new samba big band Orquestra Imperial.\n\nIntrinsically innovative at the time of its release, their eponymous debut recording is now considered an absolute classic. In a remarkable twist, the follow up wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t recorded until almost 40 years later in 2001 with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Return of The IpanemasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for Far Out Recordings. As a landmark recording by sensational veteran musicians, the album was acclaimed by the press, with The Independent and Music Week calling The Ipanemas BrazilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s closest equivalent to CubaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Buena Vista Social Club. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Afro BossaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was recorded two years later, followed by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Samba is Our GiftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in 2006 which confirmed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“their sound remains extraordinarily fresh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ exhilaratingly spacious and aerodynamicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ [The Daily Telegraph]. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Call of the GodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is their best album yet.\n\nReviews:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Ipanemas have put a lot of hard work into sounding this cool.

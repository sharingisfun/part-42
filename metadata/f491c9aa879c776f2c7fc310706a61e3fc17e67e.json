The Mesopotamian Anu, the Israelite Jahweh, the Greek Dionysos, the Gnostic Christ and the late modern Jesus were all laughing gods. Through their laughter, gods prove both their superiority and their proximity to humans.\nIn this comprehensive study, Professor Gilhus examines the relationship between corporeal human laughter and spiritual divine laughter from c`ussical antiquity, to the Christian West and the modern era. She combines the study of the history of religion with social-scientific approaches, to provide an original and pertinent exploration of a universal human phenomenon, and its significance for the development of religions.\n===========================\nReviews\n'Professor Gilhus has provided a pertinent and scholarly investigation into the significance of laughter in religion. - Theology\n\n'Laughing Gods and Weeping Virgins is a delightful and good natured study of the place and meaning of laughter in religion.' - Religion &amp; Theology\n\n'This study of laughter and religion by Ingvild Saelid Gilhus is a model of graceful scholarship written in impeccable English and presented with engaging clarity.' - David Martin, Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 13 1998\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f491c9aa879c776f2c7fc310706a61e3fc17e67e","amp;dn":"Ingvild+Gilhus+-+Laughing+Gods%2C+Weeping+Virgins+%5B1997%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f491c9aa879c776f2c7fc310706a61e3fc17e67e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,145,201,170,135,156,119,111,44,127,195,16,112,106,97,227,252,23,230,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

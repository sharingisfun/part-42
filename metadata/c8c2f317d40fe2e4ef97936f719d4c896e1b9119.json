You  play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients\n    to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.\n `\n `  To get past security, you'll need to make  creative  use  of  your  main\n `  gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a\n .  level  are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse\n .  to  wire  them  differently. So  you  can  connect  a  lightswitch  to a\n :  trapdoor, then  flick  it  when  a  guard  walks across to make him fall\n |  through.\n |\n |  Features :\n |\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Rewire levels to work however you want.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Trick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Throw yourself - and others - through plate glass windows.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Investigate  a  noir-inspired  story  of  murder and espionage over 20\n |    missions.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Choose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Choose  your  own  playstyle:  quick,  quiet,  non-violent,  no living\n |    witnesses, or any combination.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Discover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Buy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ All story stuff is skippable.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Hardest puzzles are optional.\n |  Ã¢â€¢â€˜ No bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you.                  .\n |                                                                           :\n |  More info : http://store.steampowered.com/app/206190                     |\n |                                                                           |\n `._______....::::::::::.___________________________________________________.'\n  ..--''&quot;&quot;      .       :\n.'   .----------`-------'------ r e l e a s e notes -------------------------.\ni   i                                                                        '\n|   |  1# Unzip, Unrar manually.

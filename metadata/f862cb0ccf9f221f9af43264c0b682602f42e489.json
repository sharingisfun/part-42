He argues that the brainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t.\n\nThis mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished DennettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as EdgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s John Brockman writes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe philosopher of choice of the AI community.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn't like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Harry Blume wrote in the Atlantic Monthly in 1998. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book Breaking the Spell calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand religion, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nA prolific writer, DennettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s landmark books include The MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s I, co-edited with Douglas Hofstedter, Consciousness Explained, and DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dangerous Idea.\n\n    &quot;Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher. He is the next Bertrand Russell. Unlike traditional philosophers, Dan is a student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and psychology. He's redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher.&quot;\n\nMarvin Minsky\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?

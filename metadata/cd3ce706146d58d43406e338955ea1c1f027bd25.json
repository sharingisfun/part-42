Regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, Gordie Howe (Michael Shanks) was finished playing hockey after his retirement from the National Hockey League. When he is offered a contract Ã¢â‚¬â€œ brokered by his wife Colleen (Kathleen Robertson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to play alongside his sons in the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA), the 45-year-old legend prepares for a surprising comeback. \n\nTogether with sons Mark (Andrew Herr) and Marty (Dylan Playfair) and the support of his wife, Gordie relocates his family and returns to the rink to play professional hockey with the Houston Aeros. Though many skeptics label this as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the biggest publicity stunt in hockey history,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gordie proves his critics wrong and attempts to accomplish the unthinkable of playing professional hockey and winning a championship with his sons. For one of the most beloved and iconic professional hockey stars of his era, this is Gordie HoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second chance to once again become Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mr. Hockey.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As the Howes hit the ice, they come together to discover the power of family, courage and faith.\n\n\nCast: \n\nMichael Shanks  ...

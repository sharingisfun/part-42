Watch them whenever and wherever you want. Find the Internet Video youre looking for, and Real it in. Download Internet videos with one click, build your own video playlists, or burn your favorite videos to CD or DVD with RealPlayer Plus.\n\nVersion 11 beta adds the ability to download streaming audio and video from the Internet, among other features and fixes.\n\n\n\nITUNES 9:-\n\nDuring AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music event, the company said that many of the interface changes in iTunes 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½besides the new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshinierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ chrome finish, I assumeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were designed to make the program easier to use and to make it easier to figure out how to get your media. For example, if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a type of mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½say, musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½iTunes no longer displays an empty list. Instead, you see a screen that explains how to get musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½download it from the iTunes Store or import it from your CDsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½along with links to the Store and to tutorial videos. (ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no mention of Amazon MP3, eMusic, or other services, of course.)\n\nAssuming youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already got content in your iTunes Library, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see a progress dialog on the initial launch of iTunes 9 as the program updates your iTunes library. (The new version may also update your Genius information; more on that below.) Then you can dig into the new media-browsing features. For example, the Column Browser view now lets you choose between having the browser on top (the pre-9 approach, with the track list below the browser) or on the left (with the track list to the right). The new on-the-left setting gives you a narrower track list that shows fewer columns, but if you have a large iTunes library, it lets you view more items in each column as you browseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a welcome improvement. You can also choose which columns to browse by: any one, two, or three of genres, artists, albums, composers, or groupings.\n\nThere are also minor interface changes that will trip up some users. For example, the green ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œresizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ button in the upper left corner of the iTunes window no longer toggles between Mini Player and standard mode; it now zooms the window larger or smaller, just as it does in other programs. (You can still activiate Mini Player mode by Option-clicking on the green button, pressing a keyboard shortcut, or choosing a menu command.) And in Grid view, the headerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which lets you change the grid groupings (by artist, album, genre, or composer) and adjust the album-cover sizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is disabled by default; you must enable it in the View menu.\n\nFinally, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth noting that because it now does so many things, iTunesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interface is becoming more complex. For example, there are now six sectionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Library, Store, Devices, Shared, Genius, and PlaylistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the sidebar, each of which contains its own sub-items, and each of those displays its content in the main part of the window. While Apple has indeed made progress in simplifying some aspectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s of iTunesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operation, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no longer the dead-simple program the company once touted it to be.\n\n\nMEDIA JUKEBOX 12:-\n\n More features, more power, easier to use, and now FREE.\n   The new MEDIA JUKEBOX 12.\n\nBest file organization of any digital music jukebox\nConnect your iPod or PlaysForSure device\nPlay all popular music files, and audio podcasts\nRip, Burn and Encode to multiple formats\nCreate custom Playlists and Smartlists\nExtensive Tagging capabilities\nAutomatic CD, Album art and Track look-up\nBuilt-in music services, including the new Amazon MP3 store\nFull speed Ripping and Burning\nPowerful EQ, DSP and audio effects\nPrint custom CD labels and covers\n\n\n\nSONGBIRD 1.4:-\n\nA media player supporting podcast, radio, library, music stores and much more\n\nSongbird is a media player capable of playing both video and audio files.

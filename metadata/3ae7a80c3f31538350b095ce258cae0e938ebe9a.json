Directed by William Castle - renowned creator of low-budget horror classics like The Tingler and The House on Haunted Hill - this was his only straight up science fiction feature.\r\n\r\nThe film is set in the distant future where a heroic spy broadcasts a cryptic message - &quot;The West will be destroyed in fourteen days&quot; - just moments before his memory is erased. A team of scientists is tasked with bringing him out of a cryogenic freeze and figuring out how to restore his deleted memories so that they can defend against the attack. The film takes every twist and turn imaginable until a disembodied brain floating in a globe filled with green liquid is forced to reveal its darkest secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x408, 23.976 fps, 2283 Kbps, 01h37m17s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, mono, 384 kbps\r\n\r\nBRRip, English audio, optional Spanish subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9fec4v03d/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/z38f623m7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/p62ga42bz/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/brpde2vnz/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/sqybtc6vj/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae7a80c3f31538350b095ce258cae0e938ebe9a","amp;dn":"Project+X+%281968+-+USA%29+%5Bspa+subs%5D+futuristic+espionage+sci+fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae7a80c3f31538350b095ce258cae0e938ebe9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,231,168,12,63,49,83,131,80,176,149,206,37,140,174,14,147,142,190,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

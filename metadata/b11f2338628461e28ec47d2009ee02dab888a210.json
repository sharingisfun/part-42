Dillon Brown\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://artsci.wustl.edu/files/artsci/articles/brown.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://artsci.wustl.edu/files/artsci/articles/brown.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout book :-\n\nIn Migrant Modernism, J. Dillon Brown examines the intersection\nbetween British literary modernism and the foundational West Indian novels that emerged in London\nafter World War II. By emphasizing the location in which anglophone Caribbean writers such as George\nLamming, V. S. Naipaul, and Samuel Selvon produced and published their work, Brown reveals a dynamic\nconvergence between modernism and postcolonial literature that has often been ignored. Modernist\ntechniques not only provided a way for these writers to mark their difference from the aggressively\nEnglish, literalist aesthetic that dominated postwar literature in London but also served as a\nself-critical medium through which to treat themes of nationalism, cultural inheritance, and\nidentity.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://artsci.wustl.edu/files/artsci/articles/brown.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://artsci.wustl.edu/files/artsci/articles/brown.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout author :-\n\nAbout the Author\nJ.

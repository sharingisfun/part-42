A comprehensive reference, the book offers strategies to analyze and interpret kinetic data for homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, practical design procedures, rate equations, and analytical models for improved reactor performance.\n\nAnalyzes principles and techniques for the evaluation, assessment, and optimization of reactors in the manufacturing, chemical, petrochemical, and food processing industries. Illustrates practical design procedures, rate equations, and analytical models for improved reactor performance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d19d5e7e9fa05fc88d24904b800152ac4f173d2","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reactor+Design+-+Peter+Harriott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d19d5e7e9fa05fc88d24904b800152ac4f173d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,25,213,231,233,250,5,252,136,210,73,4,184,0,21,42,196,241,115,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

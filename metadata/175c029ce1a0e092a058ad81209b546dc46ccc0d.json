Their self-titled debut is set to arrive October 1 via Roadrunner Records.\n\nLed by drummer and Slipknot member Joey Jordison, the band was rounded out in the studio by lead vocalist Henry Derek, keyboardist Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails), and guitarists Jed Simon (Strapping Young Lad) and Kris Norris (Darkest Hour). The live incarnation of the group features Derek, Simon, Norris, keyboardist Joey Blush, and bassist Kyle Konkiel.\n\nJordison says of the track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very coincidental that Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlood HostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is our first track and video because it was the first song I wrote for this project when it was nothing but a mere idea at best. Songs, of course, followed, and molded into an overall feel, concept, and now a full-length album. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlood HostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has it all: hypnotic riffs, soaring choruses, pummeling breakdowns, and the lyrics are infectious in every sense. We are very proud of the track and it pretty much lets you know where we are coming from, musically, and what we are all about live. Scar the Martyr, up close and personal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIf you like it buy the album in October!\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175c029ce1a0e092a058ad81209b546dc46ccc0d","amp;dn":"Scar+the+Martyr+-+Bloodhost.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175c029ce1a0e092a058ad81209b546dc46ccc0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,92,2,156,225,160,224,146,160,88,173,129,32,155,84,109,196,108,204,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

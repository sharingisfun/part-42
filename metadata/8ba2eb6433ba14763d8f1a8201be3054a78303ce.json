That also includes\n&quot;Andy Warhol&quot;, which in this case is sung even better by Dana Gillespie!\nIn fact he wrote the song for her originally.\n\nI don't like Dana's blues songs, but she had a beautiful voice and only\non occasion does she go into rock territory.\n\nThere is a missing track -- an early version of &quot;Queen Bitch&quot; , \nbut my understanding is that it isn't any different from the one \non Hunky Dory...except that one of them isn't in stereo.\n\nThey both had released a few albums by that time, but Dana didn't\nhave one in 1971 so she probably just released some singles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba2eb6433ba14763d8f1a8201be3054a78303ce","amp;dn":"DAVID+BOWIE+and+DANA+GILLESPIE+promo+record+%28+24+bit+--+M4a+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba2eb6433ba14763d8f1a8201be3054a78303ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,162,235,100,51,186,20,118,61,143,26,130,1,190,48,84,167,131,3,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

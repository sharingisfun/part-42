While each chapter contains the necessary background and explanations to stand alone, the diverse collection of chapters shows how developments from various fields each contributed to our current understanding of nanomolecular catalysis as a whole.\r\nThe book describes how the size and shape of materials at the nanoscale can change their chemical and physical properties and promote more efficient reactions with fewer by-products. First it highlights the preparation, characterization, and applications of heterogeneous and supported metal catalysts. Then it covers the engineering of catalytic processes, structure and reaction control, and texturological properties of catalytic systems. The authors explain how surface science can elucidate reaction mechanisms and discuss the growing role of high-throughput experimentation and combinatorial approaches in catalysis.\r\n\r\nFrom fundamental concepts to future directions, Surface and Nanomolecular Catalysis offers a well-rounded compilation of noteworthy developments which will continue to expand and transform our understanding of catalysis, particularly in the context of clean energy and environmental applications such as fuel cells","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac8e5fb86cfea004e711ba4e1af568735ed8252","amp;dn":"Surface+and+Nanomolecular+Catalysis+-+Ryan+Richards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac8e5fb86cfea004e711ba4e1af568735ed8252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,200,229,251,134,207,234,0,78,113,27,164,225,175,86,135,53,237,130,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

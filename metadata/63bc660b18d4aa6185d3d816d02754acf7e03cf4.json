The sound, though not perfect, is significantly better than the original. Also removed should be all the &quot;..end of tape 1, side 1......start of tape 1, side 2...etc. Additionally, the original was read/edited in such a way that there were elongated pauses between sentences. This to me got irritating after a while, so I painstakingly removed the long pauses, and now the flow has greatly improved. The additional amount of files is due to each one being cut to around 25-30 mins each.\n\nOverall a highly recommendable book.\n\nTotal Files: 77\nLength: 33hrs 28mins\nBitrate: 80-128kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bc660b18d4aa6185d3d816d02754acf7e03cf4","amp;dn":"The+Making+of+the+Atomic+Bomb+-+Richard+Rhodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bc660b18d4aa6185d3d816d02754acf7e03cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,188,102,11,24,212,170,97,133,211,216,22,208,39,84,172,247,224,60,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

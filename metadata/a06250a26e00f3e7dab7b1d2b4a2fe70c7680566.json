From the folk-like storytelling of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The King of the CoinersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the celebration of the simple things of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JacarandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, through to the analysis of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Madame MuseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the standard of the writing is exceptionally high. Bringing everything together is the fantastic sound of SteveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Martin Cole guitar, it has a distinct sound and his playing style is easily recognisable; combine this with a strong ear for a melody and an engaging vocal delivery and you have an album that works on every level.\nWhile Steve is the main focus on the disc, and every track is guitar focused, the songs cover an impressive range of styles and dynamics; additional instrumentation is restrained but beautifully used with Chris ParkinsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accordion obviously present with double bass, violin and percussion also present.\nAdd considered and interesting liner notes to the package and you have an almost faultless contemporary singer/songwriter album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there will be few better discs released this year.

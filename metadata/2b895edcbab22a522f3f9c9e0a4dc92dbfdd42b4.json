It's often said that no matter what else is done and what innovations are introduced, the wing defines the aircraft.\nThe A380 wing is the largest ever produced for a civil airliner, at 17.7 metres from front to back and 36.3 metres from fuselage to wingtip. The maximum length of metal in a single wing is 46 metres and the result is an aircraft with a tip-to-tip wingspan of 79.8 metres, making the A380 the world's biggest passenger aircraft.\nThe film follows some of the people who work at the two main Airbus factories in the UK. In Filton, near Bristol (which has manufactured aircraft for almost 100 years, including Concorde) we meet engineers and designers at the company's cutting-edge research and development facility, and in Broughton, in North Wales, one of Europe's biggest factories, we meet the people who actually build the massive wing.\n\nEnjoy\n\nPls help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b895edcbab22a522f3f9c9e0a4dc92dbfdd42b4","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+How+to+Build+a+Super+Jumbo+Wing+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b895edcbab22a522f3f9c9e0a4dc92dbfdd42b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,137,94,220,186,178,42,82,47,63,156,158,10,77,201,45,191,221,66,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The selections favor straight-up disco and house over the sort of ambient experimentation that might have been culled from the original material. But the dub-styled &quot;Flowers Become Screens (Return Mix)&quot; and--on the spacier second disc--a goth-tinged take on &quot;Silence (Fade&amp;#039;s Sanctuary Mix)&quot; offer a breather from the collection&amp;#039;s rather athletic nature. Besides a clutch of previously released tracks, Odyssey also includes rare mixes of &quot;Underwater,&quot; &quot;Euphoria (Rabbit in the Moon&amp;#039;s Divine Gothic Disco Mix),&quot; and &quot;Heaven&amp;#039;s Earth (Matt Darey Remix).&quot; And Delerium&amp;#039;s trademark ethereal guest vocal tracks remain largely intact, so you can float and dance at the same time.\n(Review by Kieran Grant from Amazon.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7733591ccf1d3c2a0869a0f3ce7d24ec83327d68","amp;dn":"Delerium+-+Odyssey%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7733591ccf1d3c2a0869a0f3ce7d24ec83327d68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,51,89,28,207,29,60,42,8,105,160,243,206,125,36,236,131,50,125,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

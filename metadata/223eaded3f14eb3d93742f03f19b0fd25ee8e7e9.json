Most remarkable is Adele Jergens as Reva, a saloon singer with a strong personality. She does an excellent musical number about a guy she meets and thinks will order wine, but asks for two beers instead and for her to pay the bill. Raymond Massey, the villain and Scott arrive at the same time in Prescott, Arizona and each will go his own way on different sides of the law. Scott becomes friendly with S.Z. Sakall,( less of a caricature than in most of his films), and starts earning enough money to make a living and get married to Reva, but Massey is there to spoil his plans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223eaded3f14eb3d93742f03f19b0fd25ee8e7e9","amp;dn":"Sugarfoot+%281950%29+76+min.Randolph+Scott%2CRaymond+Massey%2CWestern.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223eaded3f14eb3d93742f03f19b0fd25ee8e7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,62,173,237,63,20,235,61,147,116,47,3,241,155,15,210,94,232,231,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

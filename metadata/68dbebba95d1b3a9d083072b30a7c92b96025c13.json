Their home is tastefully decorated; their clothes are well tailored; they move in important circles. And yet, to hypersensitive Ilonka, her choice in dÃƒÂ©cor is never good enough, and her looks are never fair enough to fully win the love of her husband, who has carried with him a secret that has long tormented him: Peter is in love with Judit, a peasant and servant in his childhood home. For Judit, however, even PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affection cannot transcend that which she loves mostÃ¢â‚¬â€the prospect of her own freedom and a future without the constraints of the society that has ensnared all three in a vortex of love and loss.\n\nSet against the backdrop of Hungary between the wars, Portraits of a Marriage offers further Ã¢â‚¬Å“posthumous evidence of [MÃƒÂ¡raiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] neglected brillianceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Chicago Tribune) and his exquisite, acutely observed evocations of sacrifice and longing.\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. This autopsy of a failed marriage shows a virtuosic control of character and tone meaningfully set against the ossification of the fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle Austro-Hungarian empire. It starts with Ilonka, whose middle-class husband, Peter, is in love with his mother-in-law's maid, Judit. Ilonka's bitter tale of a fight to win her husband back, only to be outdone by the other woman, gives way to the same story told by Peter, itself followed by Judit's take. What emerges is a cubist portrait of a harsh love and a dying society, elegantly paced and delightfully contradictory. Ilonka, Peter, and Judit each possess strong philosophies on life and love, and MÃƒÂ¡rai successfully probes the blind spots and conflicting assumptions in their varied points of view. With each new voice, each very much its own thanks to Szirtes's faultless new translation, MÃƒÂ¡rai (1900Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989) builds suspense and reveals new layers and twists to this tale. Suffused with nostalgia and regret, the book evokes and examines both the nature of longing and the decline of a great empire. (Feb.) \n(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

With this phenomenal novel, our conviction, based on the MÃƒÂ¡rai novels already translated, including Embers (2001) and The Rebels (2007), is confirmed: he ranks as one of the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest novelists. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title is apt; the three sections focus on the conditions of one particular marriage: that between a Budapest industrial magnate and his beautiful wife in the deceptively peaceful years between the world wars, when the Ã¢â‚¬Å“world had not been boarded over yet; for a moment everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€Europe, life itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€was bathed in intense light.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In seeking definitions of love, and in excercising his obviously abiding interest in the theme of loneliness in marriage, the author, in a glorious demonstration of psychological acuity, offers his powerful findings from three perspectives: from the husband and from the wife, naturally, but also from the servant girl in the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ household who becomes his second wife. The idea that marriage partners keep information about themselves from each other is the outwardly simple, even ordinary, premise upon which the narrative rests; it is the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant dissection of that situation that makes this novel so exceptional. The ultimate factor in deciding if the novel works is whether the three segments mesh well enough to give the reader a smoothly integrated whole picture, and Portraits of a Marriage is the last word on the effectiveness of the triple-voice technique. --Brad Hooper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68dbebba95d1b3a9d083072b30a7c92b96025c13","amp;dn":"Portraits+of+a+Marriage+-+Sandor+Marai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68dbebba95d1b3a9d083072b30a7c92b96025c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,219,235,186,149,209,179,169,208,131,7,43,48,167,201,43,150,2,92,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

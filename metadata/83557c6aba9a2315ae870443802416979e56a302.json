The Memphis was located &quot;up the hill&quot; from the Flood Zone where DMB played many regular gigs in the 90s. This recording captures the intimacy of these early duo shows perfectly. Fans will love the playful banter between Dave and Tim and the audience. Early versions of now bonafide classics provide a different listen and Tim's stunning solo works make this,until now, unheard show a real gem. Dancing Nancies and Song That Jane Likes with Tim playing slide stand out, as well as Tim's Rheginos and the Resurrection.\n\n\nOne Sweet World\t5:09\t\nSong That Jane Likes\t3:13\nRecently\t6:57\nLie In Our Graves\t5:48\nWarehouse\t7:14\nPay For What You Get\t6:41\nReginos and the Resurrection\t7:01\nSatellite\t5:14\nMinarets\t6:00\nTypical Situation\t8:15\nAnts Marching\t5:41\nTripping Billies\t5:21\nSo Much To Say\t5:12\nYou Are My Sanity\t6:34\nGranny\t3:54\nHelp Myself\t6:42\nSeek Up\t6:19\nBlood of Our Children\t6:26\nDancing Nancies\t5:30\nBest of Whats Around\nAngel From Montgomery\t5:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83557c6aba9a2315ae870443802416979e56a302","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+-+DMBLIVE+06%2F13%2F1993+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Richmond+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83557c6aba9a2315ae870443802416979e56a302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,85,124,106,186,154,35,21,174,135,4,67,128,36,22,151,158,86,163,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

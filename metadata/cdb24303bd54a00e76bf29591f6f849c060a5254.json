The other half was of course\nthe feisty asymetrically fringed Robyn .  His melancholic\nelectro-pop framed Robyn's ballad about break-up perfectly and\nsecured it as one of the most prolific pop moments of 2007.\nAs they wrote the song together they agreed call it 'Robyn\nwith Kleerup' on her album and 'Kleerup with Robyn' on his\nalbum.\n\nHe is already a massive star in is native home having won no\nless than three awards (Best Newcomer, Best Composer and Best\nProducer) at Sweden's 2009 Grammis music awards recently (the\nequivalent of our Brits).\n\nOk, so he's huge back home, is mates with Robyn and has had a\nnumber one single in the UK. So what you may ask.  Well this\nbearded lothario with grungy locks is about to embark on\nanother assault of our shores with his own self-titled album.\n\n'Kleerup' features collaborations with Lykke Li,  Marit\nBergman, Titiyo  (Neneh Cherry's younger sister) and the of\ncourse includes his hit collaboration with Robyn.   Kleerup's\nsongs are a mixture of his familiar formula of electronica and\nSwedish female vocal. Good thing this is a formula with proven\nresults as each one is pure electro-pop perfection.\n\nThe lead single with Titiyo, 'Longing For Lullabies'\nencapsulates his warm and melancholic sound flawlessly. On the\nflip side emotive 'Until We Bleed', Kleerup draws a\nsurprisingly warm performance from the blog friendly Lykke Li.\nPlus there's a host of remixes that beef it up for the\ndancefloor from.\n\nAvailable from May 17th, album release to follow on June 1st\n2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb24303bd54a00e76bf29591f6f849c060a5254","amp;dn":"Kleerup-Kleerup-%28Advance%29-2009-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb24303bd54a00e76bf29591f6f849c060a5254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,178,67,3,189,84,160,14,118,191,41,89,31,111,132,156,6,10,82,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

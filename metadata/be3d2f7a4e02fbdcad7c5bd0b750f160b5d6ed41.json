Clarinetist Tony Scott and pianist Horst Jankowski match together very well, and the rhythm section ( which is otherwise unidentified ) is perfectly supportive of the lead voices.  Recorded live in Ljubljana ( former Yugoslavia ), the music ( three standards and four basic group originals ) finds Scott in particularly inspired form.  He romps through the uptempo pieces, and his tone is often at its coolest during the more thoughtful numbers.  Although this 1990 CD is quite obscure and there are no significant liner notes, the music is quite rewarding and frequently exciting. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nFrom www.tonyscott.it/fifties\n&quot;Fifties - part two  \nHis first one year odyssey out of the States began in 1957 through Europeto South Africa.\n\nIn Sweden he was the magnet for the best musicians in concerts and recordings.\nIn Stockholm he performed with the Harry Arnold Radio Studio Orchestra making the arrangement of Lullaby of Birdland(in the style of Bach fugue) for the February 19th Swedish Radio concert.\nScott formed in Sweden a quartet with Rune Offerman(p), Gunner Johnson(b) Egil Johnson(d), and recorded the four fantastic virtuoso 45 eps which included Swingin in Sweden, Night in Tunisia, Blues for Ava; I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Get Started; Moonlight In Vermont; All The Things You Are and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Remember April. \n\n&quot;Tony Scott gave a real vitamin injection to the Swedish jazz scene.&quot; (Orkester Journalen)\n\nThe tour went on to Denmark, Finland, Holland, Germany, France, and Yugoslavia, where, in Ljubljana, he did a live-recording with the Horst Jankowski Trio: In Concert. It was there that he performed his first improvised dedication to Charlie Parker: Blues for Charlie Parker. It was transmitted throughout the world on The Voice of America conducted by Willis Conover. From that moment on the song became the most requested and applauded in all his concerts.&quot;\n\n Personnel:\nTony Scott (Clarinet and Saxophone) \nHorst Jankowski (Piano) \nPeter Witte (Double Bass) \nHerman Mutschler (Drums)\n\nTony Scott &amp; Horst Jankowski Trio - In Concert Tracks:\n01  The Swinging Ljubijana (Horst Jankowski) 5:48 \n02  Yesterdays (Otto Harbach/Jerome Kern/Vic Youmans) 5:01 \n03  I'll Remeber April (Don Raye/Gene de Paul/Pat Johnston) 6:05 \n04  Lullaby of Birdland (George Shearing) 7:27 \n05  I'll Remeber Ljubjana (Tony Scott) 8:08 \n06  Blues For Charlie (Tony Scott) 8:24 \n07  Tam Na Gorenjskem Je Lepo (B.

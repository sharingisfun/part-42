I really liked everything in it - from the beginning till the end. Especially the end and the scene of Pushkin's funeral. At that moment I wanted to cry because the director showed Pushkin's friends and his wife. While walking near his coffin they all memorized Aleksander Sergeevich. The original score was also great and it still sounds in my heart. I liked how Sergey Bezrukov portrayed Aleksander Pushkin. He was fantastic in this role and I really believed him, I believed that he is Pushkin. I also would like to note Ana Snatkina. She played poet's wife Natalya. That role is really hard so I think she managed to do her job perfectly. Then I enjoyed watching Evgeniy Stychkin who played another famous Russian poet Mihail Lermontov. I want to thank the director of this film for choosing Stichkin. He was great! I recommend you to watch this fantastic movie. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. There are not so many good movies nowadays but &quot;Last duel&quot; is really good movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91abb5b733689601e330fe67149e8a20663c5e24","amp;dn":"Pushkin.Poslednyaya.Duel.STV.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91abb5b733689601e330fe67149e8a20663c5e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,171,181,183,51,104,150,1,227,48,254,103,20,158,138,32,102,60,94,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

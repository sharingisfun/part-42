The organisation existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages. Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. \r\n\r\nIn 1307, many of the Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake. Under pressure from King Philip, Pope Clement V disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which have kept the Templar name alive into the modern day. \r\n\r\nIn The History of the Knights Templar Charles Addison traces the rise and fall of this legendary religious-military organization. \r\n\r\nIncludes image gallery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76c63eac256fd19232fe2f763f99cddef8a4683","amp;dn":"The+History+of+the+Knights+Templar+%28Illustrated%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76c63eac256fd19232fe2f763f99cddef8a4683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,108,99,234,194,86,253,25,35,47,226,247,99,249,156,221,239,138,70,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

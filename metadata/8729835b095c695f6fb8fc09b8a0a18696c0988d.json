Instead, Kitano turned again to longtime collaborator (and acclaimed Princess Mononoke composer) Joe Hisaishi, whose elegant, jazz-fueled orchestral score imparts a cool, detached irony to the proceedings. With subtle, fleeting touches of ancient Japanese rhythms and modalities, Hisaishi weaves a moody tapestry that evokes the best of Lalo Schifrin's and Ennio Morricone's often exotic, icy '70s jazz works with its spare solo trumpet and piano lines while remaining true to the composer's compelling sense of melody and orchestral color. Its concluding title theme (and an included remix) fuses cool Euro-jazz, swelling strings, '70s disco beats, and 80's hip-hop scratching into a playfully kitschy musical stew that's as loopy as it is melodically memorable. Old school, new teacher.\n\n.: Cover :. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6541/689bc075.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6541/689bc075.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.

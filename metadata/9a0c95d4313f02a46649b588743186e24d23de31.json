Kool Roots, which compiles most of the group's Channel One output, was originally released in 1978 as a double album (standard vocal mixes on one LP, dub versions on the other) in a gatefold sleeve -- an almost unheard-of packaging extravagance for a reggae act at the time. Little more is known about the duo, and they dropped from sight after Kool Roots was released. But the haunting single &quot;In Time to Come&quot; has endured, and this reissue, which combines both LPs on a single CD, shows that Earth &amp; Stone was capable of producing consistently high-quality material. Bailey and Howell's sweet harmonies are the main attraction, but a good portion of the credit for this album's success must also go to the Revolutionaries, Channel One's crack house band. \n\n\nAllmusic review (original CD) &amp; it just got better\n\nEAC log m3u &amp; images included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0c95d4313f02a46649b588743186e24d23de31","amp;dn":"Kool+Roots+OCNRF+Disco+Special+12%26quot%3B+Extended+Remixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0c95d4313f02a46649b588743186e24d23de31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,12,149,212,49,63,2,164,102,73,181,136,116,49,134,226,77,35,222,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

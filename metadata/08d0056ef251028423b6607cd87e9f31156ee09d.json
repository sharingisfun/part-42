It was recorded immediately after the return of the group from an Asian tour, and was completed and released within two weeks. Consequently, the production was rushed and, according to Ray Davies, the band was not completely satisfied with the final cuts. Due to record company pressure, however, no time was available to fix certain flaws present in the mix. Ray Davies has expressed his dissatisfaction towards the production not being up to par. Commenting on this, he said:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tA bit more care should have been taken with it. I think (producer) Shel Talmy went too far in trying to keep in the rough edges. Some of the double tracking on that is appalling. It had better songs on it than the first album, but it wasn't executed in the right way. It was just far too rushed. \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Ray Davies, Kinda Kinks CD liner notes.\n\nThe album is noted for featuring the single &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;, which was a #1 hit on the UK Singles Charts.[5] The album itself hit #3 on the UK Album Charts. \n\nIt was released in the US with a different, rearranged track listing and repackaged cover. Several tracks were removed as well, and the single &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, released two months after the UK issue of Kinda Kinks, was unique to the album's US release. In the UK, the album was only released in mono; no stereo mix was made.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 1\t\n\n01. \t&quot;Look for My Baby&quot;   \t  \t2:17\n02. \t&quot;Got My Feet on the Ground&quot;   \t \t2:14\n03. \t&quot;Nothin' in the World  \t  \t2:44\n04. \t&quot;Naggin' Woman&quot;   \t2:36\n05. \t&quot;Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight&quot;   \t  \t2:01\n06. \t&quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;   \t  \t2:31\n07. \t&quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;   \t2:20\n08.  \t&quot;Don't Ever Change&quot;   \t  \t2:25\n09. \t&quot;Come On Now&quot;   \t  \t1:49\n10. \t&quot;So Long&quot;   \t  \t2:10\n11. \t&quot;You Shouldn't Be Sad&quot;   \t  \t2:03\n12. \t&quot;Something Better Beginning&quot;   \t  \t2:26\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 2\t\n\n01. \t&quot;Everybody's Gonna Be Happy&quot; \t2:13\n02. \t&quot;Who'll Be the Next in Line&quot; (mono single\t2:01\n03. \t&quot;Set Me Free&quot; (mono single (single1965)) \t2:09\n04. \t&quot;I Need You&quot; (mono single ) \t2:23\n05. \t&quot;See My Friends&quot; (mono single (singleUK), 1965)) 2:44\n06. \t&quot;Never Met a Girl Like You Before&quot; (mono single )) \t2:05\n07. \t&quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; (Kwyet Kinks EP ) \t2:43\n08. \t&quot;Such a Shame&quot; (Kwyet Kinks EP \t2:19\n09. \t&quot;Wait Till the Summer Comes Along&quot; (Kwyet Kinks EP 2:07\n10. \t&quot;Don't You Fret&quot; (Kwyet Kinks EP \t2:45\n11. \t&quot;I Go to Sleep&quot; (demo version) \t2:42\n12. \t&quot;When I See That Girl of Mine&quot; (demo version) \t2:02\n13. \t&quot;Tell Me Now So I'll Know&quot; (demo version) \t1:59\n14. \t&quot;A Little Bit of Sunlight&quot; (demo version) \t1:50\n15. \t&quot;There's a New World Just Opening for Me&quot; (demo\t2:31\n16. \t&quot;This I Know&quot; (demo version) \t2:01\n17. \t&quot;See My Friends&quot; (alternative take) \t2:44\n18. \t&quot;Come On Now&quot; (alternative vocal) \t1:55\n19. \t&quot;You Shouldn't Be Sad&quot; (recorded at BBC) \t1:55\n20. \t&quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot; (recorded at BBC) \t2:22\n21. \t&quot;Everybody's Gonna Be Happy&quot; (recorded at BBC) \t2:13\n22. \t&quot;This Strange Effect&quot; (recorded at BBC) \t2:32\n23. \t&quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (recorded at BBC) \t2:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d0056ef251028423b6607cd87e9f31156ee09d","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+Kinda+Kinks+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d0056ef251028423b6607cd87e9f31156ee09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,208,5,110,242,81,2,132,35,182,96,124,216,126,159,49,21,110,224,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

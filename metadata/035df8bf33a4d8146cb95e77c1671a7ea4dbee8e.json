I'm that DJ from the east village / manhattan, made famous by the night managers at bennysburritos.com (I played Rock'n'Roll, sometimes Punk, or Hard-core Punk,or Reggae, and very little Rap.) \n\nLinda,the bartendress there, played keyboard and sang, with a sweet voice, opposite a guy who went by his last (?) name, Orion. I guess you would call it punk rock, although they were not teenagers. Once, after a gig in manhattan / the lower east side, Linda came over my apartment in the east village, with another girl. I offered them red wine and cherry heering (a cordial), and we tried out some songs, and played on my guitar...but I was too chicken to let it go any further, scared because there were two ladies, not one; I think they wanted it to be a threesome, with little ol' me in the middle. So after an hour or so, they left. I never had another &quot;date&quot; with Linda, although I saw her many times when ordering tequila and mexican food at her place of work, while DJ'ing.

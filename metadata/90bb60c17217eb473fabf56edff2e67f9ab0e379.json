In X-Treme Latin he provides Latin with an attitude, an indispensable phrasebook that taps the secret power of Latin to deliver, in total safety, hundreds of impeccable put-downs, comebacks, and wisecracks. Within its pages you will learn how to insult or fire coworkers; blame corporate scandals on someone else; cheer at a World Wrestling Entertainment match; talk back to your computer, TV, or Game Boy; deal with your road rage; evade threatening situations; snowboard in style; talk like Tony Soprano; and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90bb60c17217eb473fabf56edff2e67f9ab0e379","amp;dn":"X-Treme+Latin-Henry+Beard.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90bb60c17217eb473fabf56edff2e67f9ab0e379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,187,96,193,114,23,235,71,63,171,245,110,223,242,230,127,154,176,227,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

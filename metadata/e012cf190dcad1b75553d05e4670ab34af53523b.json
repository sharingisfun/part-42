The specific moves of Bhangra reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The folk dance has been popularised in the Western World by South Asian communities and is seen in the West as an expression of Indian and Pakistani culture as a whole.[2] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.............................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bruin Bhangra\n\n After five successful years, and earning a well-deserved title as the one of the most impressive bhangra competitions in the nation, Bruin Bhangra VI promises to live up to its distinguished reputation and bring you an evening of entertainment more spectacular than ever seen before.

I'm Casey and the countdown rolls on.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nThere is a hit in this countdown by the former Motown group whose lead singer has turned down offers to record solo for 19 years.\n\nThe man who tried for eight years to make it in rock and roll but had to switch to country to get a hit has that former number one in this countdown.\n\nThere is an in-show extra by the man who had to complete US Army basic training twice, the second time for saluting a high ranking officer with a shovel.\n\nCarly Simon is at number 11 with her hit, &quot;You're So Vain.&quot; It has been in the top 40 for 13 weeks, longer than any other song on the chart.\n\nA listener wants to know what song had the longest time span between different versions of it hitting the top 40. Casey says the earliest version of this song was on the very first Billboard chart ever published and then again 21 years later.\n\nIn 1968 there was a record on the chart that was a country instrumental duet. It featured a banjo and was from the soundtrack to a motion picture that was nominated for several academy awards. Here, five years later, there is another record with all those same traits.\n\n40.

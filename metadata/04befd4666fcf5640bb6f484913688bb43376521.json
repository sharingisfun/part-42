Every class, race, item or feat of those books, including most of the character creation chapter.\n\nWhat is changed?\n- Measuring units from Imperial to the Metric System (kilograms instead of pounds, meters instead of feet).\n- Spaces for thousand separator instead of commas (1 000 000 instead of 1,000,000).\n- All available erratas are applied and minor fixes that I noticed were made, the rest is mostly untouched.\n- It's in two columns (like Heroes of Shadow and Heroes of the Feywild) but in A4 format (sorry USA, A4 trumps Letter)\n\nWhy I did that? To have all the essential character management sources in one place with minimum redundancy and easy to lookup on the game table.\n\nOnly get this if you already have all the source books and to use only for personal use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04befd4666fcf5640bb6f484913688bb43376521","amp;dn":"Essential+Heroes+%28D%26amp%3BD+Essentials+Compilation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04befd4666fcf5640bb6f484913688bb43376521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,190,253,70,102,252,245,100,11,182,244,132,145,54,136,187,67,55,101,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

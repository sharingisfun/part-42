Iggy has inspired and energised rock and\nroll's alternative spirit since the late sixties and John Peel was actually\nthe first DJ to play Iggy's music (as part of the Stooges) on UK radio in\n1969. Following the lecture, Lauren Laverne talks to Iggy about his musical\nlegacy and a specially-invited audience puts questions to the godfather of punk.\n\nThe annual John Peel Lecture invites a notable figure from the music industry\nto shape a debate and create insight around music and music-related media.\nTaking its inspiration from one of the greatest radio broadcasters of all time\nand a figure who perpetually challenged the status quo, the John Peel Lecture\nhas been a part of the Radio Festival since 2011. The John Peel Lecture 2014\nalso marks 10 years since Peel's passing.\n\nIggy Pop joins a list of high profile speakers who have delivered the\nJohn Peel Lecture. These are The Who's Pete Townshend in 2011, who explored\nthe implications of digital music media in an age of free downloads and a\ndisposable attitude to music; Billy Bragg in 2012 who's speech explored how\nmusic and radio need mavericks to keep moving forward; and in October 2013\nCharlotte Church delivered an insightful speech on the theme of women and\ntheir representation in the music industry.\n\n\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\nGENRE:........................: Documentary/Music Video\nFILE SIZE:....................: 1.14 GiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*480=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO AAC: ...................: 253 Kbps\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 7s\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4484730431775e4f075724f60dfa978a88780d40","amp;dn":"John+Peel+lecture+with+Iggy+pop+2014+MP4+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4484730431775e4f075724f60dfa978a88780d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,132,115,4,49,119,94,79,7,87,36,246,13,250,151,138,136,120,13,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

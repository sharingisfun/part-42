Included are extended\n\nversions of Bobby Timmons' MOANIN' and Benny Golson's  ARE YOU REAL?\n\nwhich were both on the earlier Van Gelder studio recording.\n\n\nIf forced to choose, this lineup would be my favorite of all the \n\nvariations of the Messengers.  This choice is largely based upon the\n\ncontribution of writer/arranger/tenorist Benny Golson.

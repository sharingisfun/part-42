It was sad to see Arista give Scott-Heron the boot in 1985, although it wasn't surprising -- by the mid-'80s, Arista was only interested in superstars, and Scott-Heron was never a superstar. Though the singer commanded a loyal following, it was a small following. Scott-Heron was little-known among pop fans, and although R&amp;B fans knew him for &quot;The Bottle,&quot; &quot;Angel Dust,&quot; and &quot;Johannesburg,&quot; he was never a huge name in the R&amp;B world. \nNot long before Arista dropped Scott-Heron, it released this LP, which offered one new song (&quot;Re-Ron&quot;) but contains mostly previously released material. The only gem from Scott-Heron's pre-Arista years on Flying Dutchman is the 1970s incendiary &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.&quot; \nOtherwise, The Best of Gil Scott-Heron (which spans 1970-1984) spotlights his Arista years and offers some of his most essential recordings for that label, which range from the singles &quot;The Bottle&quot; (a number 15 R&amp;B hit), &quot;Johannesburg&quot; (which went to number 29 on the R&amp;B singles charts), and &quot;Angel Dust&quot; to &quot;Winter in America,&quot; &quot;Shut 'Um Down,&quot; and &quot;B Movie&quot; (one of Scott-Heron's angry attacks on President Ronald Reagan). \nEven if you don't agree with all of Scott-Heron's politics, he was always thought-provoking and was certainly an expressive, captivating R&amp;B singer -- it's too bad he ended up spending the second half of the 1980s without any type of label deal. \nFor those who wanted an introductory overview of Scott-Heron's Arista output, this LP was, in the mid-'80s, a logical choice.

BB King playing with his idol (T-Bone Walker) on BB's birthday at the Monterey Jazz Festival 9-16-67.  The set starts off with T-Bone Walker doing what he does best.  Next, is a nice set of BB King with the last 2 songs joined by T-Bone Walker which BB claims is his idol.  During the second track with T-Bone, BB totally messes up the introductions...sounds like he's nervous playing with T-Bone.  As a bonus I've included The great Otis Rush playing in a trio format at the Prague Jazz festival with Chicago legends Fred Below and Jack Myers and Buddy Guy and Junior Wells from the same venue.  I have no other date just the 1966 year for those sets.  This is all the complete shows of these concerts that I have.\n\nThis is from Reel to Reel Masters.  My friend and I got a chance to transfer some great mono soundboards from Reel to Reels in the early 80's.  This is actually a Teac Reel to Reel to Cassette (top of the line Yamaha TC-1000 cassette deck from the 80's) and then transferred straight to my Philips CDR-765 deck. This is as close to a 1 generation as possible since the reels where sent of to never never land surplus probably never to see the light of day from the original source.  CD Burners didn't exist yet so I had to wait until they we're available to transfer this show  This is a live soundboard that may or may not have been broadcast. The sound quality speaks for itself.  Running time is about 70 minutes. \n\nHope you enjoy this as much as I have over the years.\n\nArtwork is included\n\nSource: Teac Deck Model?

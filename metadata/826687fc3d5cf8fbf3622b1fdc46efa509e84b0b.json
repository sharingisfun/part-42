This duo has consistently played for a number of years together, mainly in their hometown of Fresno, California, at open air rent parties featuring friends and family. The spark from these impromptu sessions combined with their natural passion to play is what makes this Fedora release what Slim describes as 'blues real and true to life'...' \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826687fc3d5cf8fbf3622b1fdc46efa509e84b0b","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Harmonica+Slim+-+Cold+Tacos+And+Warm+Beer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826687fc3d5cf8fbf3622b1fdc46efa509e84b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,102,135,252,61,92,248,251,243,98,43,31,220,70,239,165,9,232,75,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

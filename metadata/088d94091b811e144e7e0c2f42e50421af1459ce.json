Even though Ã¢â‚¬Å“MindlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, they have existed for over a decade. All this time they have released several demos but it was in  2012 when they started working on their first full-length release. Coma, as I said earlier, are honoring the 80s-90s heavy-thrash roots. References from Metallica, Megadeth, Testament, Anthrax, Slayer &amp; Overkill among others, are embellishing the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound in general. Most of the times they are more into the old-school thrash, but then again some heavy-thrash &amp; melodic features are being thrown in. The instruments were recorded in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own home studio and the vocals at the V-studio. The album was mixed by Riccardo Atzeni (ex-Solid Vision and Dominici) and mastered by Ettore Rigotti. The sound is quite heavy and powerful. Overall it is very good, even if it misses that punchier &amp; tighter element the big heavy-thrash bands have. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something that can easily be fixed in the future. There are also two guest appearances on the album by Craig Locicero (Forbidden) &amp; eRik Atzeni (ex-Solid Vision, ex-Dominici). Coma are showing very good signs. They have Ã¢â‚¬Å“studiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their lessons well and they have the desire to go on. I would prefer them to take care of their melodies a bit more than the aggressive-fast pace elements at some point. The heavy-thrash clichÃƒÂ©s of the genre are present all over the album but when they go a tad more melodic &amp; heavier I favor them utmost. Anyhow, this is just my point of view. I think that this is a solid debut album and Coma can be way improved in the years to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦  \n\nComa - Mindless (2013)  \n  \n  00 Coma - Mindless album art 01.JPG\t81.38 KB\n  00 Coma - Mindless album art 02.JPG\t91.39 KB\n 01 Mindless.flac\t                43.11 MB\n 02 Full Of Nothing.flac\t        26.02 MB\n 03 Last Aim.flac\t                41.39 MB\n 04 Again.flac\t                        44.11 MB\n 05 No Love....flac\t                11.57 MB\n 06 ...Only Hate.flac\t                25.13 MB\n 07 My Venom Inside.flac\t        28.61 MB\n 08 Under Attack.flac\t                15.8 MB\n 09 Old Man.flac\t                32.44 MB\n  Coma - Mindless.m3u\t                977 bytes\n  Mindless.cue\t                        1.5 KB\n  z. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.03 KB\n  z. audiochecker.log\t                616 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:088d94091b811e144e7e0c2f42e50421af1459ce","amp;dn":"Coma+-+Mindless+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"088d94091b811e144e7e0c2f42e50421af1459ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,141,148,9,27,129,30,20,78,126,12,47,66,229,4,33,175,20,89,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

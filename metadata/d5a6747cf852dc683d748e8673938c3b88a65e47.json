Anyway...\n\nThis is the big fight between Ichigo and Byakuya that is about to take place in the Bleach anime.  I've labled it the &quot;Ban Kai Fight&quot; for reasons you'll see inside.  The fight takes place in Manga chapter's 160 through 167, and it'll most likely fall into Anime ep's 58-60 (I'm guessing though)\n\nThe actual fansubbed manga was translated by Manga-Rain, but I've stolen all of the fan-colored images from Manga Rain, M7 and Silhouette and included them.\nI've also omitted all of the useless chatter from sub-characters, just to focus on the fight.\n\nThis is a HUGE spoiler for what's to come in the anime, so unless you really want to know, I advice you don't download it.\n\nThanks,\n-Xarp\n\nPS:  Manga comics are read from the top right to bottom left.  They're the opposite of american comics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a6747cf852dc683d748e8673938c3b88a65e47","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Ichigo+vs.+Byakuya%3A++Ban+Kai+Fight%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a6747cf852dc683d748e8673938c3b88a65e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,166,116,124,248,82,220,104,61,116,142,134,115,147,140,59,136,166,94,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

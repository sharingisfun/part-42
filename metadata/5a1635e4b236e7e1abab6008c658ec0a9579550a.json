In this third DLC, players will find\nthemselves in a world shining bright with the glow of treacherous ice.\nCan you find and recover the lost crown?\n\nNotes: As the game files completely updated, we've decided to make this\n       release a standalone, which includes newest DLC, pre-order DLCs,\n       Crown of the Sunken King DLC, Crown of the Old Irong King DLC \n       and the main game updated to 1.06 version.\n       This is the last DLC for Dark Souls II.\n\nSavegames from RELOADED main release are compatible.           \n     \nBlock game exe in your firewall to prevent the game from trying to go \nonline.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nMurphy notes:\n\nFor this exe file, it doesn't patch a previously installed game.\nRather it has a delta patch to change the old iron king iso to the ivory\nking iso. Since I've already upped the old iron king iso and the patch is\nless than 700mb, this seems to be a good way to go.\n\nI probably could have made delta patches and a script for the actual steam\nfiles, but that would really be a lot of work, and it's still better to have\nthe iso.\n\nMy old iron king torrent (iso source) is at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10882321&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10882321&lt;/a&gt;\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1 - copy/move the old.iron.king-to-ivory.king-patch-for-CODEX-isos.exe file to\nThe folder containing: codex-dark.souls.ii.crown.of.the.old.iron.king.iso\n\n2 - run the exe file. When the delta starts making the 2nd iso it will say that\nit is extracting using smartversion 3 32-bit version.\n\n3 - verify your hash if you wish. The ivory king iso details are as follows:\n\nFile: codex-dark.souls.ii.crown.of.the.ivory.king.iso\nSize: 14.0 GB\nSHA1: 193E4798A6AD077107498FF410B3EE6DFE949B7E\n\n-- Patch details: --\n\nFile: old.iron.king-to-ivory.king-patch-for-CODEX-isos.exe\nSize: 646 MB\nSHA1: E596A98389E32CE454E6585271E487113A65DE6B\n\nCreated using my SVF to SFX creator and smartversion 3.\nYou can make your own patches for similar isos if you wish.\nWe've put all the information and tools in the applications xdelta thread.\nI'll put a link to MDL in the torrent for those that are curious.\n\nEnjoy, and ffs buy the game if you want to see more games like it.\nI did, and you should too if you can. The last thing we need is more boring-ass CoD clones.\n\n-murph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1635e4b236e7e1abab6008c658ec0a9579550a","amp;dn":"Dark.Souls.II.Crown.of.the.Ivory.King-CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1635e4b236e7e1abab6008c658ec0a9579550a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,22,53,228,178,54,231,225,171,171,96,8,198,88,236,10,149,121,85,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

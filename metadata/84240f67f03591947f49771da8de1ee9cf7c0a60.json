Featuring\nmonolithic vocal tracks of epic scope, this release highlights\nKlayton's unique fusion of infectious electronic music with\naggressive rock &amp; roll the way only Celldweller can - by blurring\nthe lines between organic and synthetic. The title track End of\nan Empire takes listeners on a 7.5 minute dichotic journey of\nmetal-infused drum &amp; bass blasts, and a contrasting mix of lush\nvocal hooks and aggressive screams. Lost in Time clocks in with\nanother 7 minutes of vocoded vocals, driving guitar riffs and\npulsing ethereal synths, concluding with the fading lyric this\nfeeling will never die\n\nKlayton then serves up Factions, 3 sound-design oriented pieces\nre-imagined from the title tracks which transport listeners to\nthe world of Atiria and beyond. Finally, select tracks have\nbeen remixed by a group of titans suitable only for this release\nincluding platinum selling band Breathe Carolina, along with\nworld-renowned producer/ drummer/artist KJ Sawka\nPendulum/Destroid), mastermind glitch/ drum &amp; bass producer\nComaduster and FiXTs own bass-metal monster OCTiV\n\n\nPlease Keep it For Continue Seeding and Help Others To Get Download","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84240f67f03591947f49771da8de1ee9cf7c0a60","amp;dn":"Celldweller-End_Of_An_Empire_Time-CD-FLAC-2014-FORSAKEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84240f67f03591947f49771da8de1ee9cf7c0a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,36,15,103,240,53,145,148,127,73,119,29,168,222,30,233,207,124,10,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

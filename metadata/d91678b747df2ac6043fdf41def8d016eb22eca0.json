Strange, but true!  Ghapi is the huge man, with the huge voice and huge hairdo that plays up a storm on his huge drum kit!. In January 2005 Ghapi was introduced to the public.  Ghapi and his four piece band quickly won the reputation as the new Afrikaans rock sensation.  GhapiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique ability to communicate with the audience and the way in which he involves the audience in his performances, places him in a league of his own. Ghapi has already had three number one hits:  In die Diepkant In, Ek wil jou hÃƒÂª and Dis net jy.  GhapiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I like it reached the number five position on the Kovsie FM charts.  The song Wens reached number six on the OFM charts and Dis net jy number eight on the Bay FM charts. With twenty seven years of experience, Ghapi is no newcomer to the music industry.  Most people got to know Ghapi between 1989 and 2004 as singer and drummer for the group Georgia. Ghapi is not only a singer, writer, composer and drummer of note, but also manages his own record company, Rock Till You Drop Records.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://server.needawebsitetoday.co.za/ghapi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://server.needawebsitetoday.co.za/ghapi/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nALBUMS:\n\nIII                  2013\nROCK IT, VOL 1       2009    \nWIE EK IS            2008\nIN DIE DIEPKANT IN   2005\n\nALL TRACKS IN MP3 FORMAT, 256kbps\n\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!\n\nENJOY !!\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91678b747df2ac6043fdf41def8d016eb22eca0","amp;dn":"Ghapi++-++4+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91678b747df2ac6043fdf41def8d016eb22eca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,22,120,183,71,223,42,198,4,63,223,65,222,248,208,22,235,34,236,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

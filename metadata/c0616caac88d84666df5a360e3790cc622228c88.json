Dickens' haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers thetrue nature of his 'great expectations'. \n\nCharles Dickens' career was marked by one extraordinary storytelling achievement after another. But perhaps none of his novels shines brighter than the brilliant &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, a quintessential work of Western literature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0616caac88d84666df5a360e3790cc622228c88","amp;dn":"GREAT+EXPECTATIONS+Charles+Dickens.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0616caac88d84666df5a360e3790cc622228c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,97,108,170,200,141,132,102,109,245,163,96,227,121,12,198,34,34,140,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

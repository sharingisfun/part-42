In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nOf Mice and Men is a tragedy that was written in the form of a play in 1937. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to work up enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. It encompasses themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, and The Pearl, Of Mice and Men is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, in 1939 starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field, in 1982 starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley, and in 1992 starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.\n\n---\n\n  From Recorded Books:\nThis classic story of a pair of unlikely friends is probably the most moving of SteinbeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novels. A discerning comment on the loneliness and alienation of CaliforniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s farm laborers in the 1930s, Of Mice and Men is also a gripping tale of one manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s selfless love for another. Lenny, a lumbering hulk of a man with the mind of a child, and his caretaker and good friend, George, dream of owning a farm together. Now that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve landed a job on a vegetable farm in the Salinas Valley, the dream seems within their grasp. But the bossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ son has a flirtatious wife, and guileless Lenny is no match for her. In a few fateful minutes alone with her, he dashes all hope of leading a normal life. And George must make the most difficult decision imaginable. Mark HammerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful narration holds listeners captive in the delicate balance between lush prose and tense foreboding. This is one of those rare books that invariably touches your heart with every encounter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73590c11763ac85bc2e71edd28d2f74abeb22f23","amp;dn":"OF+MICE+AND+MEN+-+John+Steinbeck.+Read+by+Mark+Hammer+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73590c11763ac85bc2e71edd28d2f74abeb22f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,89,12,17,118,58,200,91,194,231,30,221,40,210,247,74,190,178,47,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

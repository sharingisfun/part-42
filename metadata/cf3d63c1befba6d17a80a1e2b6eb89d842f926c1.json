But after the downpour, and the lethal contagion it spread, came an even greater horror: the rampant transformation of the dead into something utterly unearthly.\nWith a terrifying new form of life emerging from the mutated landscape, EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only hope is to flee toward distant Alaska where she can unite with the survivors who have reached out to her from a remote science facility. The journey from New York will be long and painstaking, and Emily has only her faithful dog and whatever she can carry. But, after discovering a small family of refugees along the way, EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determination to escape the unfolding catastrophe and carve out a new future is renewed. Standing in their way are EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new masters, equally determined to survive and thrive, and possessed of monstrous capabilities Emily and her allies canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t begin to imagineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re face to face with the hideous reality.\nIn the battle about to begin, there will be no room for mistakes or mercyÃ¢â‚¬â€only the most ruthless instincts to survive.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3d63c1befba6d17a80a1e2b6eb89d842f926c1","amp;dn":"Exodus+by+Paul+Antony+Jones+%28Extinction+Point%2C+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3d63c1befba6d17a80a1e2b6eb89d842f926c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,61,99,193,190,251,166,209,122,128,161,226,182,235,137,216,66,249,38,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

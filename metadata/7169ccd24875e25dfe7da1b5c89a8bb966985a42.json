Could they also house other life forms? were they created not only to shelter, but to hide things they may not want the public to see? They are across the country, in various locations. In the video below, Philip Schneider was an ex-government structural engineer who was involved in building underground military bases around the United States , and to be one of only three people to survive an incident that occurred in 1979 between Grey aliens and U.S. military forces at the Dulce underground base.\n\nFor the last two years of his life, Schneider gave lectures about government cover-ups, black budgets, and UFOs. Schneider was never able or willing to prove his allegations (e.g. showing the entrance to Dulce Base). His claims received little mainstream notice, but caused quite a buzz in UFO enthusiast circles. Schneider was found dead in his apartment on January 17 1996 Some suggest Schneider was murdered. Phil Schneider died on January 17, 1996, reportedly strangled by a catheter found wrapped around his neck Ã¢â‚¬â€ the bizarre death being dismissed by the authorities as suicide. If the circumstances of his death seem highly controversial, they are matched by the controversy over his public statements uttered shortly before his death. Phil Schneider was a self-taught geologist and explosives expert. Of the 129 deep underground facilities Schneider believed the US government had constructed since World War II, he claimed to have worked on 13. Two of these bases were major, including the much rumored bioengineering facility at Dulce, New Mexico.\n\n \n\n \nAt Dulce, Schneider maintained, Ã¢â‚¬Å“grayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ humanoid extraterrestrials worked side by side with American technicians. In 1979, a misunderstanding arose. In the ensuing shootout, 66 Secret Service, FBI and Black Berets were killed along with an unspecified nurnber of Ã¢â‚¬Å“graysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It was here he received a beam-weapon blast to the chest which caused his later cancer; many have confirmed that a large scar indeed existed. Schneider maintained that numerous previous attempts had been made on his life, including the removal of the nuts from one of the front wheels of his automobile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7169ccd24875e25dfe7da1b5c89a8bb966985a42","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+72+-+DUMBS+Deep+Underground+Military+Bases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7169ccd24875e25dfe7da1b5c89a8bb966985a42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,105,204,210,72,117,226,93,254,125,161,181,200,154,139,185,102,152,90,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

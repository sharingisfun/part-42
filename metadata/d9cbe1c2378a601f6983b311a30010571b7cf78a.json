It was his seventh album of original material, and was released in 1982, at a time when his music was moving away from large-scale symphonic pieces towards a more accessible pop style. It is one of the very few albums on which Oldfield sings lead vocals, as he is other noted for not having any confidence in his voice's qualities. The album uses the Fairlight CMI as a main instrument.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

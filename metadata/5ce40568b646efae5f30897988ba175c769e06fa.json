Now Berlinski returns with Peacekeeping, an equally enthralling story of love, politics, and death in the worldâ€™s most intriguing country: Haiti.\r\n\r\nWhen Terry White, a former deputy sheriff and a failed politician, goes broke in the 2007â€“2008 financial crisis, he takes a job working for the UN, helping to train the Haitian police. Heâ€™s sent to the remote town of JÃ©rÃ©mie, where there are more coffin makers than restaurants, more donkeys than cars, and the dirt roads all slope down sooner or later to the postcard sea. Terry is swept up in the townâ€™s complex politics when he befriends an earnest, reforming American-educated judge. Soon he convinces the judge to oppose the corrupt but charismatic SÃ©nateur Maxim Bayard in an upcoming election. But when Terry falls in love with the judgeâ€™s wife, the electoral drama threatens to become a disaster.\r\n\r\nTense, atmospheric, tightly plotted, and surprisingly funny, Peacekeeping confirms Berlinskiâ€™s gifts as a storyteller. Like Fieldwork, it explores a part of the world that is as fascinating as it is misunderstoodâ€”and takes us into the depths of the human soul, where the thirst for power and the need for love can overrun judgment and morality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce40568b646efae5f30897988ba175c769e06fa","amp;dn":"Peacekeeping_+A+Novel+-+Mischa+Berlinski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce40568b646efae5f30897988ba175c769e06fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,228,5,104,182,70,239,174,95,48,137,121,136,186,23,92,118,158,6,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

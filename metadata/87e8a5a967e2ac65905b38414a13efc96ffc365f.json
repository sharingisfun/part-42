He spends his life getting into prisons to study their designs and the guards' habits to find and exploit their weaknesses, thus enabling him to escape without a hitch. He claims his goal is to ensure that criminals sent to prison stay there due to an unexplained event related to his seemingly dead wife and child. One day, he and his business partner Lester Clark are offered a multimillion dollar deal by CIA agent Jessica Miller to test a top-secret prison and see if it is escape-proof. It is an obvious setup and Breslin goes against all his own rules and chooses the money. Breslin agrees to the deal and gets himself captured in New Orleans, Louisiana, under the guise of a Spanish terrorist named &quot;Portos&quot;, but the plan goes awry when his captors remove the tracking microchip from his shoulder and drug him on the way to the prison.\n\nBreslin wakes up in a complex of glass cells with no outside windows to indicate the prison's location. He meets inmate Emil Rottmayer, and they both stage a fight for Breslin to study the solitary confinement cell, which uses high-powered halogen lights to disorient and dehydrate prisoners. Seeing that the cell floors are made of aluminum, but the rivets are steel, Breslin has Rottmayer procure a metal plate from Warden Willard Hobbs's office floor before the both of them and Muslim inmate Javed are once again thrown into solitary. Using the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights to heat the rivets and pop open the floor panel to reveal a passageway below. He goes through the passageway and discovers that the prison is inside a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, making a simple escape impossible. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to work on studying the complex by learning the guards' daily routines, and Breslin gives Hobbs false information about Rottmayer's boss, Victor Mannheim. Meanwhile, Breslin's colleagues Abigail Ross and Hush grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen. They discover from hacked documents that the prison, codenamed &quot;The Tomb&quot;, is owned by a for-profit organization linked to Blackwater, and Clark was offered a US$5 million annual salary from them in exchange for keeping Breslin behind bars.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e8a5a967e2ac65905b38414a13efc96ffc365f","amp;dn":"Escape+Plan+%282013%29+CamRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e8a5a967e2ac65905b38414a13efc96ffc365f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,232,165,169,103,226,172,101,144,91,56,65,74,19,239,201,111,252,54,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

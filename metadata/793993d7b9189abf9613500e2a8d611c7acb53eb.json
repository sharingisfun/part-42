I straightened\n      all that out as best I could, threw out some duplicate or near-duplicate\n      pages serving as nothing more than filler, and consolidated the covers\n      into galleries (same as in all my compilations). All in all, these\n      versions should give you a significantly smoother read. :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793993d7b9189abf9613500e2a8d611c7acb53eb","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones%3A+Hedge+Knight+1%2B2+%282003-08%7CDgtl-GN-HR%29+%28re-edit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793993d7b9189abf9613500e2a8d611c7acb53eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,57,147,215,185,24,154,191,150,19,80,14,42,141,97,28,122,203,83,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

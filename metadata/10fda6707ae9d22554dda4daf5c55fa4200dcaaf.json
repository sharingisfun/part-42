This show was truly fantastic. I was right and the band was right on. I could not believe the stuff they were doing onstage. Even Jerry was in shorts with some weird little slip on loafers. And let me tell you , the man and the band were on fire here. Jerry was smiling , laughing talking to Brent and just having fun. Ive been to my fair share of shows and something about this one burned into my brain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10fda6707ae9d22554dda4daf5c55fa4200dcaaf","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1990-07-06+-+Cardinal+Stadium+in+Louisville%2C+KY+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10fda6707ae9d22554dda4daf5c55fa4200dcaaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,253,166,112,122,233,210,37,84,221,164,218,245,197,95,164,32,13,202,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

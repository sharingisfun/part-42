What makes this one interesting for me is Kim Greist. I&amp;#039;ve always found her intriguing but underused and this is a very rare starring role for her. There are a lot of pin-up type actress&amp;#039;s in this film and Greist although very attractive, is not that sort of actress. So her intelligence and character stand out even more. Even in a real silly story such as this is enough to showcase her natural talent. I hope to see more of her. In anything!\n\nAVI Information\nFilename: Roger.Corman.Presents.Last.Exit.to.Earth.(Showtime Original)Xvid-SER.avi\nFilesize: 734029824 Bytes (700.03 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\nVideo Stream\nCompression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\nAvg.

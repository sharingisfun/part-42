In October 2003, TreadwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remains, along with those of his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, were discovered near their campsite in AlaskaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Katmai National Park and Reserve. They had been mauled and devoured by a grizzly, the first known victims of a bear attack in the park.\n\n\n\n\nGrizzly Man could easily have been sensational and exploitative, but in the hands of Werner Herzog, it becomes something extraordinary. Herzog was granted exclusive access to over 100 hours of video shot by amateur naturalist, wildlife advocate and troubled loner Timothy Treadwell, who spent 13 summers in Alaska's Katmai National Park, where he grew to know and love the grizzly bears that lived there. He was also killed by one of them, in October 2003, along with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard, and that seemingly inevitable fate informs every minute of Herzog's riveting combination of Treadwell's video with his own expert filmmaking and unique vision of nature and man. \n\nWhereas Treadwell was a naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve nature-lover and social outcast whose sanity was slowly slipping away, Herzog is a pragmatic mythologist who views nature primarily in terms of &quot;chaos, hostility, and murder,&quot; and the disparity of their vision results in a magnetic attraction that makes the sum of Grizzly Man greater than its parts. \n\nWe come to admire the dreamer, the idealist, the failed actor and recovered alcoholic man-child that was Treadwell, and we equally admire the seeker of truth and wisdom that is Herzog. They belong together, in some world beyond our world, where visionaries join forces to create life after death. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated &amp; Directed by: Werner Herzog\n=====================================\n\n\nProduced by: Erik Nelson\n=========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Grizzly Man\nYear.................:    2005\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:44:08\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    145 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x336\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1040 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (External English + Swedish)\nFile Size:...........:    700 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427312/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427312/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nNote: External ( English + Swedish) included.\n=============================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ***  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s)on\n\nmy older torrents instead,thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                          \n                          &quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD&quot;                        \n\n\n\n                      ***** AWARD WINNING DOCUMENTARY *****\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e7440065f4cef676eac4a4d9c9defce08e07d5f","amp;dn":"Grizzly+Man-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e7440065f4cef676eac4a4d9c9defce08e07d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,116,64,6,95,76,239,103,110,172,74,77,156,157,239,206,8,224,125,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

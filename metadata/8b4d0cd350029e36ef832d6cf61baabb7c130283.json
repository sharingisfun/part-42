The mammoth tour was an huge and incredible success. Vanessa-Mae received overwhelming reviews from fans and media. Vanessa-Mae\\\\\\'s concert in the London Royal Albert Hall was filmed and put on general release by EMI on video tape. Over the years, the concert has been televised in many countries all over the world numerous times. EMI Malaysia released a DVD version of the concert in 1998. The live registration as it is on the tape and DVD gives a good impression for all of the fans who have not seen Vanessa-Mae live at the \\\\\\'Red Hot Tour.\\\\\\' A glossy brochure was available as merchandise at the \\\\\\'Red Hot Tour\\\\\\' concerts.\n\nThe concert itself was a spectacular show during which Vanessa-Mae showed her effortless and fluent technique, and during this performance she proved to be a real \\\\\\'explosive live artist\\\\\\' capable of crossing over instantaneously to playing different styles of music with an ease and authority that only \\\\\\'the real masters of their instruments\\\\\\' can do. Critics detest the setting in which \\\\\\'their sacred classical music\\\\\\' is presented. During the concert when she going into her classical break, Vanessa-Mae makes a funny joke to respond to this criticism. Most importantly, during her Red Hot Tour of concerts and during all her concerts in tours thereafter, Vanessa-Mae receives standing ovation over and over again form her fans for her unique stage performance and brilliant play. This live registration gives a very good impression to all viewers what concerts of Vanessa-Mae are about. This live registration is a must for all devoted fans of Vanessa-Mae.\n\nVanessa-Mae at this concert: \nFor this concert, Vanessa-Mae was dressed in a silver glittering short dress with a black belt over it that hold the equipment to plug in the electric violin ad her earphone. She also had bright white short boots with normal heels. This particular dress is certainly not one of my favorite outfits to see Vanessa-Mae in; she had this dress during 1995 and early 1996 a few times during the tour and also at her famous open air performance on Time Square, New York. Vanessa-Mae had her hair tied in a pony tail on her back. The many close-ups show that, despite her very young age of not only 17 yet at that moment, Vanessa-Mae\\\\\\'s face was made up with complete covering light colored foundation, soft red lipstick and discrete small dark lines of shadow on her upper eye lids. The captures below show a series of these close-ups from one scene when Vanessa-Mae addressed the audience, and from the closing scene of Vanessa-Mae gratefully accepting the ovations from her fans. In these captures also some of the closing credit lines are shown. \n\nTrack listing\nVanessa-Mae played the following music at her concert:\n\n- Contradanza  (Mike Batt) - Cotton Eye Joe (Ericsson, Oban, Reiniz) - Fantasy on a theme of \\\\\\'Caravans\\\\\\'  Mike Batt) -\n- Aurora  (Ian Wherry, Vanessa-Mae) - Widescreen  (Mike Batt) - \n- Piano trio in E minor: Allegretto (4th movement - Shostakovitch) - Liebeslied (Kreisler) - Schon Rosmarin (Kreisler) - \n- Moses Fantasy on one string (Paganini, arr.

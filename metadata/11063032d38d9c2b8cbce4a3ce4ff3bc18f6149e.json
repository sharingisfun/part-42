Title hopefuls Liverpool and Arsenal meet at Anfield, where the Gunners have been unbeaten in their last six visits. Chelsea vie to maintain their title push at the expense of a Newcastle side, who deservedly won the reverse fixture in November, while Manchester City travel to Norwich, who suffered a club record-equalling 7-0 defeat when the sides last met. In the late kick-off, new Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes his side to Swansea for the south Wales derby.\n\n\nNotes:\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps to give much smoother movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11063032d38d9c2b8cbce4a3ce4ff3bc18f6149e","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-02-08+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11063032d38d9c2b8cbce4a3ce4ff3bc18f6149e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,6,48,50,211,141,156,43,140,188,228,163,206,79,243,188,24,246,20,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

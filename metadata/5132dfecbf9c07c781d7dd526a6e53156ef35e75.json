Zimmer&amp;#039;s colorful, luminous melodies boast a lyricism long absent from his work, evoking the mysteries of the former Burma in striking detail -- while synthesizers add clarity and depth to the music, Zimmer steadfastly avoids any pronounced Western motifs and themes, communicating the exotic otherness of his subject with aplomb.\nTracks\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTitle \n\n\nPerformer \n\n\nTime \n\n \t  \t1 Waters of Irrawaddy\t  \t 3:46\n \t  \t2 Memories of the Dead\t  \t 1:43\n \t  \t3 I Dreamt I Woke Up\t  \t 8:41\n \t  \t4 Freedom from Fear\t  \t 1:06\n \t  \t5 Brother Morphine\t  \t 1:03\n \t  \t6 Our Ways Will Part\t  \t 7:11\n \t  \t7 Village Under Siege\t  \t 4:07\n \t  \t8 Beyond Rangoon\t\n\n\nFrom allmusic.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5132dfecbf9c07c781d7dd526a6e53156ef35e75","amp;dn":"Beyond+Rangoon%281995%29+Original+Soundtrack+by+Hans+Zimmer+%5BAAC+160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5132dfecbf9c07c781d7dd526a6e53156ef35e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,50,223,236,191,156,7,199,129,215,221,82,106,110,83,21,110,243,94,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

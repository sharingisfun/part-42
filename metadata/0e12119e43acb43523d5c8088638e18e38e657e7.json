Changes being the first, &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; were both made into videos. The CD single is very rare and, as many other Tupac Shakur CD and vinyl singles, it is known as a collector's item among fans. It was never officially released in an uncensored version.\n\nThis is the unreleased uncensored version.\n\nEnjoy a beautiful classic.

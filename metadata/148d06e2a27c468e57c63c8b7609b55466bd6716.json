Those affected are left to reconstruct who they are - from relearning the basics of walking, talking and eating to redeveloping complex personality and behavioural traits, often in the shadow of who they once were. Family members are often caught between grieving for the loved one they have lost and learning to love the person they are now.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 009 MiB\r\nDuration : 58mn 40s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 404 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 308 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148d06e2a27c468e57c63c8b7609b55466bd6716","amp;dn":"BBC+Louis+Theroux+A+Different+Brain+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148d06e2a27c468e57c63c8b7609b55466bd6716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,141,6,226,162,124,70,142,87,198,60,139,118,9,181,84,102,189,103,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

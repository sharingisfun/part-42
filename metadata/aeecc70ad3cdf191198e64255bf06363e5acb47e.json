In clear, easily accessible language the text explains how the brain and nervous system are linked to mental disorders. It integrates information from many aspects of neurobiological research, including imaging, neuropsychology, and genetics in order to foster an in-depth understanding of the psychiatric presentation of disorders that mental health professionals encounter in their practices.\n\nTo facilitate student learning and clarify the connection between neurobiological foundations and clinical presentation, the text includes case studies, cognitive data, imaging results, genetic testing results, and illustrations. It examines major psychological disorders from behavioral, emotional, biological, cognitive and neurophysiological perspectives as they relate to brain structure and the major systems. Special topic sections highlight ethical, research, and treatment concerns for mental health practitioners. Each chapter concludes with summations and review questions. Written for graduate level students in clinical, counseling, and school psychology programs, the text fulfills APA accreditation requirements for coursework in the biological bases of behavior. While the text's primary aim is to help students understand neurobiological information as an important component of a therapeutic framework, it also concisely addresses micro and macro anatomy as relates to neurobiology. Also included are such supplementary teaching materials as test questions and PowerPoint slides of illustrations.\n\nKey Features:\n\nFocuses on the connection between neurobiology and clinical presentation\nHighlights special topics in neurobiology ethics, research, and treatment\nIntegrates information from imaging, neuropsychology, and genetics testing\nPrepares graduate students in clinical, counseling, and school psychology for professional practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeecc70ad3cdf191198e64255bf06363e5acb47e","amp;dn":"Applied+Biological+Psychology-+Getz+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeecc70ad3cdf191198e64255bf06363e5acb47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,236,199,10,211,205,241,145,25,142,100,37,91,240,99,99,229,172,180,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Lowered the chroma and saturation. Added a little contrast, denoised, sharpened and a few other things. Not to bad for a cam, however it does have a slight flicker and some camera movement at times. Now for the audio we used PrisM's audio that IMAGiNE had cleaned up, so thanks to both of them for their work on the audio and to whomever recorded it.\n\nUPLOADER NOTES\nIMHO...Rx has a little better audio than PrisM &amp; Rx video is a little brighter than IMAGiNE...PLEASE COMMENT :)\n\ncredit Rx &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c141e9df8b25feb574158b53e36cad1dbe7d9456","amp;dn":"Knight.And.Day.2010.CAM.XviD-Rx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c141e9df8b25feb574158b53e36cad1dbe7d9456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,65,233,223,139,37,254,181,116,21,139,83,227,108,173,29,190,125,148,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

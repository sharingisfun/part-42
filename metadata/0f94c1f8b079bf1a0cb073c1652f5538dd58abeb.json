She is left with taking care of her aging father and gets no support from her sister on this. The welfare societies turn down her request for taking in her father due to her not being below poverty line. One day while returning home with her father, at the spur of moment she abandons her father in a park bench after asking him to wait there while she gets water. Going home anonymously she calls an orphanage to have the old man picked up, but when they go the old man turns them down saying his daughter will certainly come back go get him. The kids keep asking where is Grandpa and feeling remorse she searches for him throughout the city through the night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f94c1f8b079bf1a0cb073c1652f5538dd58abeb","amp;dn":"La+Demora+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f94c1f8b079bf1a0cb073c1652f5538dd58abeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,148,193,248,176,121,191,26,12,176,115,193,101,47,85,56,221,88,171,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In many states, domestic abusers can easily evade federal background checks by ordering a gun online, purchasing it at a gun show, or buying it from a private seller.\n\nEven when public outrage pushed the gun control debate to centre stage, the US Senate blocked a federal proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases.\n\nThis week, Fault Lines travels to South Carolina, a state with the highest rate of women killed by men, to explore the circumstances that put women at risk of domestic violence homicide.\n\nshunster-webrip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a880053bc1ab18d476c4190d4e2c541d03a8d069","amp;dn":"Death+in+Plain+Sight++2014+++AJ++Fault+Lines++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a880053bc1ab18d476c4190d4e2c541d03a8d069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,128,5,59,193,171,24,212,118,196,25,13,78,44,84,29,3,168,208,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

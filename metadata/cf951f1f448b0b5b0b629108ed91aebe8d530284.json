Surely one of the most unsung bands in the history of American Hard Rock music, Bang released no less than three full-length albums for Capitol in the early '70s that criminally sank without trace. Undoubtedly the heaviest of Americas proto-metal bands from the period, they also had a strong sense of melodic power, which really should have led them to much bigger things. Often cited as being the closest band America had to Black Sabbath in the early 70s, there is much more to Bang than being mere copyists. This can finally be witnessed here on this deluxe CD set, which encapsulates all of the bands recorded output from their Capitol Records Period, which spanned from 1971-1974. Also included in here is the previously unreleased debut album Death Of A Country, which was initially rejected by Capitol, as being a heavy concept album that they thought no one would understand. Highly regarded as a cult band by many for years, it's now time for this truly amazing rock band to be enjoyed by a new audience.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf951f1f448b0b5b0b629108ed91aebe8d530284","amp;dn":"Bang+-+Bullets+%282010%29+%5BBox+Set%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf951f1f448b0b5b0b629108ed91aebe8d530284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,149,31,31,68,139,11,91,11,98,145,8,237,145,174,190,141,83,2,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

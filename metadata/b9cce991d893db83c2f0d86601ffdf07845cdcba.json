Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Season 9 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help.\n\nSpanish and French subs I believe\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9cce991d893db83c2f0d86601ffdf07845cdcba","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+9+Disk+1+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9cce991d893db83c2f0d86601ffdf07845cdcba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,204,233,145,216,147,219,131,194,240,216,102,1,255,223,7,132,92,220,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

And what is on offer this time? There's the obvious hit or two thrown in; Oasis' Songbird, Starsailor's Alcoholic and Dido's Here With Me. However, there are some magnificent tracks lurking amongst songs you probably already own. Michael Andrews and Gary Jules's Mad World from the Donnie Darko soundtrack is the undoubted highlight. I Am Kloot's Untitled # 1 should also merit an honourable mention. There are some more obscure tracks on here - Tom McRae's You Cut Her Hair from his excellent debut album and Ryan Adam's In My Time of Need from 2000's Heartbreaker album are introductions to non-mainstream acts that may inspire interest.\n\nThere's old stuff on here as well. The Velvet Underground's fantastic Sunday Morning and Dylan's She Belongs To Me are two great artists at their best.\nI do take issue with the definition of acoustic - the Electric Soft Parade's Empty at the End, whilst being a great track, is clearly an amped up performance. However, on a compilation that includes the magnificent Jeff Buckley, Mercury Rev, Beth Gibbons, Elbow and Beth Orton, it would be wrong of me to complain.\nThere's something for almost everyone on here, and if you don't already own 50% of the tracks on it, it's worth the investment.\n\nDisc: 1\n1.

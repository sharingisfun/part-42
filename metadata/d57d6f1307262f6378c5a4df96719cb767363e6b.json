In doing so, it charts the progress westwards of those who claimed new land as their own, and defended it with forts and blockhouses, and the resulting conflicts with indigenous Native American peoples. Packed with detailed illustrations, this book provides a fascinating study of the westward advance of modern America, and covers sites such as Fort Point at the entrance to San Francisco Bay, the Presidio of San Francisco, Fort Guijarros in San Diego, California, Fort Humboldt in Eureka, California, Sutter's Fort, the 19th-century agricultural and trade colony in California, and Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in Washington and Oregon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57d6f1307262f6378c5a4df96719cb767363e6b","amp;dn":"Forts+of+the+American+Frontier%2C+1776-1891%3A+California%2C+Oregon%2C+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57d6f1307262f6378c5a4df96719cb767363e6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,125,111,19,7,38,47,99,120,197,164,223,150,113,156,183,103,54,62,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

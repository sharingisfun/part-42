This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey remembers the only three acts in chart history to occupy the number 1 and 2 spots at the same time.\n\nThe highest debuting act of the week, The Fixx, helps set a new chart record. Casey tells how.\n\nIn the rock era, there have been three top 40 hits that have named future years in their titles. 1999 is in the countdown. Casey names the other two.\n\nCasey explains how the song &quot;Spill The Wine&quot; by Eric Burdon And War got its name.\n\nThis is the first week of eight at #1 for &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (1984 Grammy Awards' Song of the Year).\n\nLW#1: FlashdanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦What A Feeling - Irene Cara\n40: Try Again - Champaign\n39: Rock And Roll Is King - ELO\n38: China Girl - David Bowie\n37: Faithfully - Journey\n36: White Wedding - Billy Idol\n35: Stop In The Name Of Love - Hollies\n34: Rock Of Ages - Def Leppard\n33: Always Something There To Remind Me - Naked Eyes\n32: It's A Mistake - Men At Work\n31: Let's Dance - David Bowie\n30: Saved By Zero - The Fixx\n29: Take Me To Heart - Quarterflash\n28: (Keep Feeling) Fascination - Human League\nLDD: You Needed Me - Anne Murray\n27: Roll Me Away - Bob Seger\n26: Wishing - A Flock Of Seagulls\n25: Maniac - Michael Sembello\n24: Beat It - Michael Jackson\n23: Hot Girls In Love - Loverboy\n22: Cuts Like A Knife - Bryan Adams\n21: Affair Of The Heart - Rick Springfield\n20: Sweet Dreams - Eurythmics\n19: Baby Jane - Rod Stewart\n18: She Works Hard For The Money - Donna Summer\n17: All This Love - Debarge\n16: She's A Beauty - The Tubes\n15: 1999 - Prince\n14: Stand Back - Stevie Nicks\n13: Is There Something I Should Know - Duran Duran\nExtra: Spill The Wine - Eric Burdon And War\n12: I'm Still Standing - Elton John\n11: Family Man - Hall &amp; Oates\n10: Our House - Madness\n9: Don't Let It End - Styx\n8: Come Dancing - The Kinks\nLDD: All Right - Christopher Cross\n7: Time - Culture Club\n6: Wanna Be Startin' Something - Michael Jackson\n5: Too Shy - Kajagoogoo\n4: Never Gonna Let You Go - Sergio Mendes\n3: FlashdanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.What A Feeling - Irene Cara\n2: Electric Avenue - Eddie Grant\n1: Every Breath You Take - The Police\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67830890f1a0e43074fb48023c564b52f3e8b64","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1983_July_9th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67830890f1a0e43074fb48023c564b52f3e8b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,120,48,137,15,26,14,67,7,79,180,128,35,197,100,181,47,62,139,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

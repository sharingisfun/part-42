The young heir to the Wayne empire disappeared seven years ago. His vast fortune has been given away, and the crime wave that began with the brutal murder of his parents has turned Gotham City into a living hell. The last holdouts against corruptionÃ¢â‚¬â€the cops who can't be bought, the D.A.'s who can't be intimidatedÃ¢â‚¬â€are outnumbered and outgunned. They need help . . . fast.\n\nA world away, in a dank Himalayan prison, a nameless, hardened man fights every day to survive. He has spent seven years scouring the globe, studying the criminal mind, looking for an answer to the ugly riddle of his childhood. but something has been looking for him, too. Here, in the darkest places of his own anger, Bruce Wayne will discover his destinyÃ¢â‚¬â€and an ordinary man will become a legend.\n\nThe Dark Knight (#2): A light shines over Gotham, a light that projects the symbol of a bat. The citizens who embrace it have accepted a masked crusader as their protector, while the criminals and corrupt who shun it are prey to the Dark Knight.\n\nThe Batman continues to wage his war on crime, reigniting hope in the city and inspiring others, like newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent. Regarded as the White Knight who will be at the center of the city's resurrection, Dent is ready to carry on Batman's fight. But before Batman steps aside, he sets his sights on dismantling all of Gotham's organized crime.\n\nWith the help of his trusted allies, Alfred, Lucius Fox, and Lieutenant Jim Gordon, Batman corners the mob, giving Dent the opportunity to convict them all. But in the mob's wake, a new class of criminal is on the rise, one that can't help but laugh as he drives Gotham's elected savior to the edge of insanity and forces the Dark Knight ever closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31ad04bed4db9c8045b82f8133ac53338241ca7d","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight+2+book+set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31ad04bed4db9c8045b82f8133ac53338241ca7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,173,4,190,212,219,156,128,69,184,47,129,51,172,83,51,130,65,202,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Challenges which are systemic and deeply rooted in many outdated systems &amp; structures Ã¢â‚¬â€ Energy, Economic, Government, Social &amp; Environmental. Old ways of doing &amp; thinking have become increasingly unsustainable and unviable, and are in need of great transformation.

A substantial part of this equation is clean sustainable energy. Solving the energy crisis would radically change Ã¢â‚¬â€ EVERYTHING.\n\nWe believe humanity already has the solution for the energy crisis. For decades leading edge scientists, researchers and paradigm breaking inventors have demonstrated advanced clean and sustainable energy technologies and applications. The first of these are preparing to enter the global market now.

The comic was written by Doug Moench, drawn by Rodney Ramos, and Val Mayerik, and lasted for 11 issues. The series focused on Toxie battling against the evil Apocalypse, Inc. and its demonic Chairman. The title was a mix of traditional superhero storytelling and satire, including the phrase &quot;hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength&quot; being repeated many times, and Toxie's &quot;Tromatons&quot; erupting when he was in danger similar to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Marvel's series also contained much in the way of &quot;over-the-top&quot;, cartoonish violence. No other Marvel characters ever appeared in the series, and Toxie never made his way into any other Marvel comic, although a crossover with Marvel's RoboCop title was planned before that series was cancelled.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aff7fca7786199cc6292d8541a732651d6ca82c","amp;dn":"Toxic+Avenger+%23+1-11+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aff7fca7786199cc6292d8541a732651d6ca82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,255,127,202,119,134,25,156,198,41,45,133,65,167,50,101,29,108,168,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

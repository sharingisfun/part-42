The commonality was Howard Publications, the self-made publishing empire of Glenn Howard (Gene Barry). Episodes featuring Howard focused on his business and political confrontations and his flamboyant lifestyle. Other episodes featured Jeff Dillon (Anthony Franciosa), a crusading investigative reporter, or Dan Farrell (Robert Stack). Farrell was a retired FBI agent who used his position as the editor of &quot;Crime Magazine&quot; to wage a literary war against organized crime. Common to all three elements was Peggy Maxwell (Susan Saint James), the bright, ambitious and occasionally kooky editorial assistant to all three men.\n\n1.

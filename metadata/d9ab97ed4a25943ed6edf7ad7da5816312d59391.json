Later ideas look at the origins of social networking and the latest developments on the Web, such as The Cloud and the Semantic Web.\n\nFollowing the design of the previous titles in the series, this book will be in a new, smaller format. It provides an informed and fascinating illustrated history of our most used and fastest-developing technology.\n\n**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ab97ed4a25943ed6edf7ad7da5816312d59391","amp;dn":"100+Ideas+That+Changed+The+Web+-+Jim+Boulton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ab97ed4a25943ed6edf7ad7da5816312d59391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,171,151,237,74,37,148,62,214,237,247,173,125,165,129,99,18,213,147,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A wealthy shipbuilder who is an acquaintance from college days approaches Scottie and asks him to follow his beautiful wife, Madeleine. He fears she is going insane, maybe even contemplating suicide, because she believes she is possessed by a dead ancestor. Scottie is skeptical, but agrees after he sees the beautiful Madeleine.\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/labgpaaeh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/labgpaaeh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mabgbaaeh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mabgbaaeh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mabgcaaeh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mabgcaaeh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a071aa5b8ecb38269d2b2aa721108ff09542f3","amp;dn":"Vertigo.1958.DVDRip.x264.aac.Incl.Audio.Comm.14.Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a071aa5b8ecb38269d2b2aa721108ff09542f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,160,113,170,91,142,203,56,38,157,43,42,167,33,16,143,240,149,66,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I was driving through Missouri last week, during the shooting and subsequent riots in Ferguson.  I'm sure many of you have been following that in the news.  Please join me and pray for God's hand in that ongoing situation.\n\nWhile in the area, I decided to stop at a Family Christian Store in Florissant (W Florissant Ave for those of you familiar with the area) to pick myself up a couple of CDs, including the new Raggamuffin which I'm bundling today.\n\nAnyway, standing there at the music rack, flipping through the CDs, I noticed another couple also picking out music for themselves.  They seemed excited about finding Family Force 5, as well as Canton Jones's new &quot;God City USA&quot; release.  Maybe you had to be there to appreciate it, but it was kind of funny to me because the man seemed to have to get approval from his wife before he bought them.  And because of that, it caught my attention.  I overheard her saying something to the effect of, &quot;You just downloaded those.&quot;  And then she seemed set on only letting him have one of the two, but he still pushed for both.\n\nI quietly wondered to myself if he had got them from somewhere else online, or perhaps he got them through some effort which we are doing right here with these torrents.  Whatever the case, what mattered most was what happened next.  The couple headed to the cash, and checked out with both the CDs.\n\nNow I'm not gullible enough to believe everyone who downloads these bundles will ultimately do the right thing and purchase it.  I'm not even naive enough to believe that those of us who have the financial means to afford it will in fact reach into our wallets.  But it sure was nice to see that couple buy both, even though they apparently already had it.\n\nOnto business...\n\nIncluding today's 44th Bundle, we have now shared 1538 titles this year.  In comparison, we hit 1669 (57 Bundles) for 2013.  1461 (55 Bundles) for 2012.  964 (36 Bundles) for 2011.  So if we're able to continue at this rate for 2014, we ought to be able to blow away those totals from previous years.  That might not mean much to some of you, but to me, one extra album, one extra song means one extra chance to bring someone closer to the Lord.

Ronald was a fugitive member of the Black Panthers who sought refuge in Deanna's home in the village of Lake Loon, Nova Scotia in the early 70s.\n\nLiving under the alias, Francis Beaufils, he soon radicalized the Lake Loon residents' thinking about what it meant to be Black in Nova Scotia at the time. But after years of community work, he suddenly disappeared, summarily arrested by the FBI and the RCMP and deported back to the United States to face justice.\n\nAssociate producer, Deanna Sparks was just little girl back then, but she could never forget &quot;Francis&quot; and his influence on her. Almost forty years later, she tracked him down in Atlanta, Georgia so he could share his story. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cc173df5924c23f41ed7e361dd8c3b1ea2b2228","amp;dn":"The.Panther.Next.Door.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cc173df5924c23f41ed7e361dd8c3b1ea2b2228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,193,115,223,89,36,194,63,65,237,126,54,29,216,195,177,234,43,34,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

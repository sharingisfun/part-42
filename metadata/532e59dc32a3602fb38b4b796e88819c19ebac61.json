Stuck in a dead-end job with a boss he can't stand and a materialistic girlfriend, Sam rises from a late night of barhopping to discover his whole world has changed. Literally. An avian flu outbreak has killed millions, the nation's infrastructure has crashed and a dirty bomb has destroyed Seattle. Forced to go on the run, Sam awakes to a normal world the next day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and to chaos again the day after that. A single constant between the two worlds will undo all the damage, if he can find it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but that seems impossible. In one world, anything goes. In the other, he's out of danger and sleepwalking through life. So Sam's got an even bigger problem: Which world to choose?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/tag/revolver/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/tag/revolver/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.craveonline.com/comics/reviews/136750-vertigos-revolver-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.craveonline.com/comics/reviews/136750-vertigos-revolver-review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.undertheradarmag.com/reviews/revolver/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.undertheradarmag.com/reviews/revolver/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nRevolver (2010) (c2c) (Minutemen-DTs).cbz\t190 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532e59dc32a3602fb38b4b796e88819c19ebac61","amp;dn":"Revolver+%282010%29+%28c2c%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532e59dc32a3602fb38b4b796e88819c19ebac61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,46,89,220,50,163,96,47,179,139,75,121,110,136,129,156,25,235,172,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

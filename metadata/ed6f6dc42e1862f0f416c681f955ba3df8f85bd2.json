Receiving great reviews good support from both the media and the fans in and around Greece, DaKryA started touring on a broader scale, supporting such bands as MOONSPELL.\n\nIn 2009 the band began to work on new material; the main goal was to put even more emphasis on the 'theatrical' style of DaKryA, and in January 2010 the band entered the studio with engineer George Bokos (Rotting Christ) to record their sophomore album, &quot;Crime Scene&quot;.\n\nCome March 2010 the band finds themselves sitting in a studio in Sweden mixing the album together with Pelle Saether (Diablo Swing Orchestra, Draconian, Madder Morten), followed by a trip to other Swedish sound-guru GÃƒÂ¶ran Finnberg (Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Arch Enemy) for the mastering of the disc.\n\nBy summer 2010 the band has decided it's time to find strong partners for brining the music and theater of DaKryA out to the worldwide audience, and thus they team up with Intromental Management and Sensory Records for the promotion and release of &quot;Crime Scene&quot;.\n\nMany musicians joined the band through the years but only a few managed to share the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision with a strong will and become part of it. A New Era has arrived!\n\n    When seven Greek charlatans get together, the musical visions that springs from their minds, can only be described as a true freakshow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6f6dc42e1862f0f416c681f955ba3df8f85bd2","amp;dn":"Dakrya+-2010-+Crime+Scene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6f6dc42e1862f0f416c681f955ba3df8f85bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,111,109,196,46,24,98,240,244,22,198,129,249,85,186,61,248,248,91,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

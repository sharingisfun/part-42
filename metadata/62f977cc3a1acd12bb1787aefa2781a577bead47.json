With a wealth\r\nof unseen interviews, recently unearthed rushes of Queens first ever video and\r\nouttakes from the recording sessions of Bohemian Rhapsody itself, this is the\r\nunique story of early Queen, told by the band themselves.\r\n\r\nThis documentary completes the final part of the trilogy alongside Days of Our\r\nLives and Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender.\r\n\r\nIts simple. Its real. Its raw. Its what happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/56036437241327144471.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/41840794801830486856.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/55757677464505122846.png\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 556 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO MP3:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 57mn 3s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f977cc3a1acd12bb1787aefa2781a577bead47","amp;dn":"+BBC+-+Queen+From+Rags+To+Rhapsody+2015+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f977cc3a1acd12bb1787aefa2781a577bead47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,249,119,204,58,26,205,18,187,23,135,174,250,39,129,165,119,190,173,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

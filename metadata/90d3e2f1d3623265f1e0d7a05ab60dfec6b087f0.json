Of the approximately 50 major naval engagements fought in the 18th century, the Nile stands unrivalled as the most decisive, for it enabled the Royal Navy to wrest control of the Mediterranean back from the French, at the same time isolating Bonaparte's army in Egypt by severing its lifeline of sea-borne reinforcements and supplies. If there was ever any possibility of Bonaparte reaching India, Nelson's victory put paid to such a grand project. This book uses the latest research, new maps and specially commissioned artwork to tell the story of one of the great sea battles of the era","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d3e2f1d3623265f1e0d7a05ab60dfec6b087f0","amp;dn":"Nile+1798%3A+Nelson%27s+First+Great+Victory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d3e2f1d3623265f1e0d7a05ab60dfec6b087f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,211,226,241,211,98,50,101,241,224,215,160,90,182,13,254,198,176,135,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The air war effectively ended at 10.58am on August 9th 1945, when a solitary B-29 Superfortress over the Japanese city of Nagasaki dropped the second atomic bomb. The Stukas carried 250kg bombs: the a-bomb dropped by the B-29 was equivalent to 23,000 tons of TNT. In just six years of warfare, air power had changed and grown in destruction capability almost beyond recognition.\nBased on the international bestselling book by Walter Boyne, CLASH OF WINGS is the definitive film history of aerial warfare during World War Two. Immensely detailed and packed with the very best authentic film footage from archives around the world, the series covers the air war in every theatre from 1939 to 1945.\nFrom the earliest blitzkriegs to the pounding of mainland Japan, from the Battle of Britain and the Blitz to the massive USAF and RAF bomber raids into the heart of Nazi Germany and from the great aircraft carrier duels in the Pacific to the bitter air battles over the Soviet Union, CLASH OF WINGS details the great air battles of the Second World War as never before.

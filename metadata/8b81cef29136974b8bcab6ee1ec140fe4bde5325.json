Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Season 9 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help.\n\nSpanish and French subs I believe\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b81cef29136974b8bcab6ee1ec140fe4bde5325","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+9+Disk+2+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b81cef29136974b8bcab6ee1ec140fe4bde5325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,129,206,242,145,54,151,75,139,202,182,238,30,193,64,254,75,222,83,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

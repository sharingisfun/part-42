Burnside, and Fred McDowell to forge a distinct sound. Sure, the guitars ring even more like the Allmans' with the addition of Burnside's son Duwayne, who harmonizes his six-string with Luther Dickinson's on plenty of tunes. But improved vocal performances and pop-savvy arrangements make numbers like &quot;Eyes,&quot; &quot;Kids These Daze,&quot; &quot;One to Grow On,&quot; and the hip-hop-informed &quot;Be So Glad&quot; ready for rock radio. Happily, the foursome haven't sidestepped their deep blues roots. The late cane fife master Othar Turner appears on &quot;Be So Glad,&quot; and they cover Kimbrough's &quot;Meet Me in the City&quot; with all of its original swing and swagger, plus the warm, joyful tone of Dickinson's expert slide playing. &quot;The One Thing,&quot; with its roiling acoustic guitar intro and steel-guitar-style string-bending, unfurls like an epic. It evolves from country blues to country rock and then dives into a gently exploratory jazz-blues instrumental passage before returning to its flat-four beat. If this CD gets the attention its well-written songs and fine playing deserve, the Allstars' smart and solid fusion may well become the foundation for a new school of Southern rock. --Ted Drozdowski \n\nRolling Stone Magazine\n&quot;...exuberant moderism-manic cotton-field psychdelia. The Allstars may be children of tradition, but they're digging deep in undiscovered country.&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a696e33b2042f69e2ae84e5fdbd696469dbdc266","amp;dn":"North+Mississippi+Allstars+-+%5C%27Polaris%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a696e33b2042f69e2ae84e5fdbd696469dbdc266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,150,227,59,32,66,246,158,42,232,78,95,219,214,150,70,157,189,194,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

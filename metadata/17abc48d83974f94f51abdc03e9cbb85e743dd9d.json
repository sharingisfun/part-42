Based on this understanding, Bashar shares a GUIDED MEDITATION for accelerating your own unique vibration of light.\n\nQ&amp;A: Dreams about vehicles. Having a spider phobia. How common is abduction? Communicating with your guides. The causes of allergies and asthma. Experiencing blocks in creativity. Letting the environment dictate who you are. The Montauk Project. Using a tesseract. Cellular acceleration test used by the Greys. DNA markers in the Founders and humans. The importance of feeling grounded. Vitamin O. Blue-green monatomic crystal.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKnowledge is free!\nShare it, seed it, grow it!\n\nMake earth a better place! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17abc48d83974f94f51abdc03e9cbb85e743dd9d","amp;dn":"Bashar+-+Nature+Of+Physical+Reality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17abc48d83974f94f51abdc03e9cbb85e743dd9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,171,196,141,131,151,79,148,245,26,189,192,62,156,187,133,231,67,221,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

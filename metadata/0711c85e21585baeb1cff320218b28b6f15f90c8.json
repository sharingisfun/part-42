(Tryin' To Love While I \nCan.&quot; &quot;You Gotta Be Puttin' Me On&quot; was titled &quot;You Gotta Me \nPuttin' Me On.&quot; &quot;Things&quot; was titled &quot;The Things We Used To \nDo.&quot; Everything has been corrected and now all files are \ntitled and tagged correctly.\n\n \n________________________________________\n\nLife's Like Poetry is a gigantic, 12-disc box set that includes all of Lefty \nFrizzell's recordings for Columbia and ABC, plus early demos, a session with \nJay Miller, and several radio transcriptions -- everything he recorded between \n1950 and 1975. Certainly, the box is designed for collectors -- no one but the \nmost devoted fan could listen to all 330 tracks. Though all of his classic \nmaterial is included, there is also a fair share of mediocre material, including \nsome ill-advised attempts at country-pop. Nevertheless, there are gems sprinkled \nthroughout the collection and it offers proof of his far-reaching talents and \ninfluence, as well as demonstrating that several of Lefty's later recordings were \nas worthwhile as his early singles. For any serious fan, it is an indispensible \ncollection. \n\n\n-- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0711c85e21585baeb1cff320218b28b6f15f90c8","amp;dn":"Lefty+Frizzell+-+Life%27s+Like+Poetry++%5B12+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0711c85e21585baeb1cff320218b28b6f15f90c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,17,200,94,33,88,91,174,177,207,243,32,33,139,40,182,241,95,144,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

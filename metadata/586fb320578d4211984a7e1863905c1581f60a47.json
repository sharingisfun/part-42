Sigh...... so many great ones including &quot;The Great One&quot; himself.  Most gone now but not forgotten.\n\nA story about an experienced sargeant and the soldier he &quot;guides&quot; along.\n\nA classic. Funny, touching, and some tugs at the heart strings.  A must see and a must for the classic collection.\n\nThis was requested almost a year ago.  Finally found, dl&amp;#039;d, watched, remembered.  Here you go.\n\nWide screen, black and white, english, no subs, I think it is very high quality VHS or DVD at a slightly lower than usual resolution.  Slightly off if expanded to 22&quot; wide screen display.  Absolutely does not get in the way of watchability.\n\nIMDB:\nThe bond of friendship between a worldly-wise Army Master Sergeant and his naive worshiper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586fb320578d4211984a7e1863905c1581f60a47","amp;dn":"Soldier+in+the+Rain+-+1963.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586fb320578d4211984a7e1863905c1581f60a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,111,179,32,87,141,66,17,152,74,126,24,99,144,92,21,129,246,10,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After building their Scrapheap monsters and    \n  driving them more than a thousand miles across this green and         \n  pleasant land, the five favourite funsters arrive in bonny Scotland   \n  for a watery challenge.                                               \n                                                                        \n  Here at Loch Lomond, they have just eight hours to convert their      \n  road-going revellers into seaworthy speedboats ready for a 200-metre  \n  dash on the waves.

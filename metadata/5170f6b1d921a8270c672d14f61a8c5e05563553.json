Hammond handles drums plus a bit of vocals and synthesizer on the session Ã¢â‚¬â€œ working alongside Durrah in a groove that mixes electric and acoustic instrumentation into a totally righteous sound with lots of heavy Afro Jazz leanings. A number of tracks feature great vocals from Hammond Ã¢â‚¬â€œ righteous, and with a beautifully souful message-oriented approach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a few other tracks, such as the classic &quot;Space I&quot; and &quot;Space II&quot;, feature a sparer all-electric sound. The whole thing's wonderful Ã¢â‚¬â€œ skittishly rhythmic, warmly flowing, and righteously beautiful. Titles include &quot;Sea Of Nurnen&quot;, &quot;Fidalgo Detour&quot;, &quot;Reflections&quot;, &quot;Space&quot; (I &amp; II), and &quot;For Real&quot;. CD also features 2 bonus tracks from singles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Kai&quot; and &quot;Venus Fly Trap&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5170f6b1d921a8270c672d14f61a8c5e05563553","amp;dn":"Doug+Hammond+-+Reflections+In+The+Sea+Of+Nurnen+%281975%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5170f6b1d921a8270c672d14f61a8c5e05563553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,112,246,177,217,33,168,39,12,103,45,20,246,26,140,94,5,86,53,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

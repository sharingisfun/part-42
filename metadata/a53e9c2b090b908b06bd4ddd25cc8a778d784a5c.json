J. Hargreaves et al. (CRC, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-1262-7\r\n\r\nConcern about the fate of waste products produced by a wide range of industrial processes has led to the realization that they may have potential uses and, therefore, value. In an effort to develop more sustainable processes and reduce waste storage, the use of waste as a resource has been gaining attention worldwide. Consequently, there have been a large number of studies aimed at utilizing such wastes. Conversion of Large Scale Wastes into Value-added Products discusses various selected classes of large-scale waste and their current applications and potential future applications.\r\n\r\nThis book provides a snapshot of a continually evolving field, which includes both well-established processes and a drive toward developing strategies for new applications of wastes. The first chapter provides a general introduction to the area of large-scale waste utilization, including drivers for waste recovery, and secondary processes and products for waste reuse. Subsequent chapters discuss applications and potential applications in specific classes of large-scale waste:\r\n\r\nVarious types of waste generated from different metal processing operations\r\nWaste generated by coal combustion, a major source of power generation that produces enormous quantities of waste\r\nWaste electrical and electronic equipment, important for recycling finite resources and reducing health and environmental risks\r\nFood waste, a significant and diverse waste stream with economic and environmental impacts\r\n\r\nThe final chapter presents a general conclusion to the broad subject of waste utilization, summarizing the topics and addressing future trends in waste research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53e9c2b090b908b06bd4ddd25cc8a778d784a5c","amp;dn":"Conversion+of+Large+Scale+Wastes+into+Value-added+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53e9c2b090b908b06bd4ddd25cc8a778d784a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,62,156,43,9,11,144,139,6,189,77,221,37,204,138,119,141,120,74,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

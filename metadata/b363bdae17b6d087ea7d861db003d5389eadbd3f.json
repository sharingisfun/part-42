This CD is a underground collectors must.\n\nI GUESS THE MIXTAPE HAS BEEN FLOATING AROUND A BIT. HERES THERE REAL DEAL, STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSES HAND. MUCH BETTER SOUND QUALITY THAN THE EARLIER RELEASES WITHOUT POSTPRODUCTION. UNDERGROUND IN ITS ORIGINAL RAWEST FORMS. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis mixtape is the debut underground release from new artist GEN Zulu. Zulu is an unsigned artist, who uses his music to inspire thinking and change. this much political and racially driven album, is infused with Tupac Shakur, giving us a fresh, new sound, and some things to think about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b363bdae17b6d087ea7d861db003d5389eadbd3f","amp;dn":"ZULU+MUZIQ+AMERICAS+MOSTWANTED+HIPHOP+MASTERPIECE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b363bdae17b6d087ea7d861db003d5389eadbd3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,99,189,174,23,182,208,135,234,125,134,29,176,3,213,56,158,173,189,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

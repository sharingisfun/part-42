Structural features, phase transitions and phase diagrams are discussed in detail. The available experimental data on lyotropic mixtures is presented in the unifying context of the Landau theories. This phenomenological approach is used for establishing connections between structural properties and phase diagrams. The book is suitable for use as a pedagogical introduction to the subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28995593ea157299a159d2e6ba7f9cfafaae7054","amp;dn":"The+Physics+of+Lyotropic+Liquid+Crystals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28995593ea157299a159d2e6ba7f9cfafaae7054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,153,85,147,234,21,114,153,161,89,210,230,186,127,156,250,250,174,112,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

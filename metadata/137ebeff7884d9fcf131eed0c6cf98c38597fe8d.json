Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear --\n&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.' \n\n\n\n\nThe Penguin Audiobook of the Selected Poems of Shelley, excellently read by, amongst others, Jeremy Northam and Alex Jennings, and interspersed with a literate and interesting biographical commentary. Unreservedly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:137ebeff7884d9fcf131eed0c6cf98c38597fe8d","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Shelley+-+2+-+Penguin+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"137ebeff7884d9fcf131eed0c6cf98c38597fe8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,126,190,255,120,132,217,252,241,49,238,208,198,207,152,195,133,151,254,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

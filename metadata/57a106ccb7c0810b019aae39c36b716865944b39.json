Then a chance meeting sends Blythe crashing into something she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expectÃ¢â‚¬â€an undeniable attraction to a dark-haired senior named Chris Shepherd, whose past may be even more complicated than her own. As their relationship deepens, Chris pulls Blythe out of the stupor sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in since the night a fire took half her family. She begins to heal, and even, haltingly, to love this guy who helps her find new paths to pleasure and self-discovery. But as Blythe moves into calmer waters, she realizes Chris is the one still strangled by his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s traumatic history. As dark currents threaten to pull him under, Blythe may be the only person who can keep him from drowning.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57a106ccb7c0810b019aae39c36b716865944b39","amp;dn":"Left+Drowning+by+Jessica+Park+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57a106ccb7c0810b019aae39c36b716865944b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,161,6,204,183,192,129,11,1,154,174,57,195,107,113,104,101,148,75,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

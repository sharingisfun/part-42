And when something's that big and deadly, you know it's gonna attract the Grendels! The devil-clan has transformed the former spectator sport into a brutal test of honor and merit, with the Indy 5000 the ultimate test. Enter Albert, a social misfit who wants to make his name driving the 5000. He's in good with the Grendels, so getting entered's not a problem. But something still stands in his way -- something called Albert's Mother.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9a03025555f1892ac596af5ebe6980b3b405f7","amp;dn":"Grendel+Tales+-+The+Devil+May+Care","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9a03025555f1892ac596af5ebe6980b3b405f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,154,3,2,85,85,241,137,42,197,150,175,94,190,105,128,179,180,5,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

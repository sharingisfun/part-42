Smart Publications, 1997), at a time when only a handful of clear thinking, knowledgeable doctors had ever heard about bio-identical hormones. Many women first learned the truth about HRT and BHRT from that first book; others later heard about it from TV celebrity Suzanne Somers, who described her personal experiences with a different version of BHRT in the first of a series of books.\n\nBut the real stampede away from HRT and toward BHRT began in 2002 with the premature termination of a large, government-funded study-the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)-the results of which confirmed that the risks of conventional HRT unquestionably outweighed its benefits. In their new updated book, /Stay Young &amp; Sexy with Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement: The Science Explained/, authors Wright and Lenard have brought to light many examples of forgotten or ignored scientific studies combined with up-to-date clinical experience that provide solid support for the safety and benefits of BHRT.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81809e688faf3e12eb1ca1ae549e758774a85576","amp;dn":"Stay+Young+%26+Sexy+with+Bio-Identical+Hormone+Replacement+-+The+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81809e688faf3e12eb1ca1ae549e758774a85576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,128,158,104,143,175,62,18,235,28,161,174,84,158,117,135,116,168,85,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

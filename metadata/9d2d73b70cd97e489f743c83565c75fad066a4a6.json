(CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-981-4669-73-3\r\n\r\nNanomaterials: Science and Applications reports up-to-the-minute research on nanoparticles for drug delivery and applications in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for biosensors; melanin as a nano-based future material; nanostructured materials for solar cell applications; the world of quantum dots illustrated by CdSe; and gas transport and transport-based applications of electrospun nanofibers. The research is primarily undertaken within Australia and gives an excellent overview of topics in advanced nanomaterials and structures and their applications.\r\n\r\nThe reader also gets a tutorial introduction to the computer software used to generate 3D illustrations that are used throughout the book. The first authors are early-career researchers from the Australian Nanotechnology Network","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2d73b70cd97e489f743c83565c75fad066a4a6","amp;dn":"Nanomaterials+-+Science+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2d73b70cd97e489f743c83565c75fad066a4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,45,115,183,12,217,126,72,159,116,60,131,86,92,117,250,208,102,164,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

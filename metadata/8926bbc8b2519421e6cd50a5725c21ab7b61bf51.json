The owner, the author of this book, could have done the normal thing and sell the wet merchandise to a Jobber--a business that buys damaged goods in bulk for cheap. Instead, he did the OUTRAGEOUS thing--he advertised in a very OUTRAGEOUS way which resulted in receiving much more than he would have received from the Jobber. It was easy. \n\nHere is an OUTRAGEOUS idea--it's easy to make a lot of money from advertising. That's right, easy money! This book, OUTRAGEOUS ADVERTISING THAT'S OUTRAGEOUSLY SUCCESSFUL, explains in certain terms how to advertise and make money. No more guesswork. That's OUTRAGEOUS by itself! Lots of advertising programs claim to want to help you stand out. This one works. This is material you can use immediately. Presented by Advertising Guru Bill Glazer, who has spent years teaching this at seminars, implementing it in the trenches in his own Baltimore menswear business, and providing it to dozens of clients in all industries.\n\nOUTRAGEOUS ADVERTISING THAT'S OUTRAGEOUSLY SUCCESSFUL gives you the secrets to succeeding with the most effective advertising of all--OUTRAGEOUS advertising. \nRich with examples and stories showing exactly how to implement a successful OUTRAGEOUS program, this book cracks the code on getting a return on your advertising dollars--an OUTRAGEOUS return! Glazer points out that the biggest advertising day of the year, the Super Bowl, became that way because people expect to see OUTRAGEOUS ads. OUTRAGEOUS ads get attention, and this book proves you can do it without the Super Bowl ad. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon product page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8926bbc8b2519421e6cd50a5725c21ab7b61bf51","amp;dn":"Bill+Glazer+-+Outrageous+Advertising+%5BMarketing%5D+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8926bbc8b2519421e6cd50a5725c21ab7b61bf51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,38,187,200,178,81,148,33,230,205,80,165,114,92,33,171,123,97,191,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

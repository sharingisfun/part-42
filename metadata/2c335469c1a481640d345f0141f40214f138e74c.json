The twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population, consumption, and technology, placing a colossal load on all natural systems, especially earth, air, and waterÃ¢â‚¬â€the very elements of life. The most urgent questions of the twenty-first century are: where will this growth lead? Can it be consolidated or sustained? And what kind of world is our present bequeathing to our future?\n\nIn A Short History of Progress, Ronald Wright argues that our modern predicament is as old as civilization, a 10,000-year experiment we have participated in but seldom controlled. Only by understanding the patterns of triumph and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age, can we recognize the experimentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inherent dangers, and, with luck and wisdom, shape its outcome.\n\nLecture 1 - Gauguin's Questions\nLecture 2 - The Great Experiment\nLecture 3 - Fools' Paradise\nLecture 4 - Pyramid Schemes\nLecture 5 - The Rebellion of the Tools ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c335469c1a481640d345f0141f40214f138e74c","amp;dn":"CBC+Massey+Lectures+2004+-+Ronald+Wright+-+A+Short+History+Of+Pr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c335469c1a481640d345f0141f40214f138e74c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,51,84,105,193,164,129,100,13,52,95,1,65,244,2,20,241,56,231,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was unknown whether the album name was official or not. The title of the album was later confirmed by 50 Cent in a interview with MTV News. The album was thought to be possibly released under Interscope, by a new contract of the label and the rapper; also the Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine revealed that he wants to sign the rapper to Interscope again, and he asked label mate 50 Cent \\&quot;what can I do to sign Lloyd Banks again?\\&quot;. Banks has said that he is willing to re-sign, but only if Interscope is willing to issue an apology for &quot;doubting him.\\&quot; On August 13, 2010\n\n\nTHE EXPLICIT VERSION \n\nArtist: Lloyd Banks\nTitle: H.F.M.2 (Hunger For More 2)(Deluxe[Explicit])itunes and F.Y.E exclusive\nGenre: Hip-Hop\nRelease date: 2010\nAudio codec: MP3\nFormat: tracks\nQuality: 320 kbps\nCovers: Yes\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nNo.\tTitle\t\n1.\tTake Em to War (featuring Tony Yayo)\n2.\tUnexplainable (featuring Styles P)\n3.\tPayback (Ps and Qs) (featuring 50 Cent)\t\n4.\tHome Sweet Home (featuring Pusha T)\n5.\tBeamer, Benz, or Bentley (featuring Juelz Santana)\t\n6.\tSo Forgetful (featuring Ryan Leslie)\tRyan Leslie\t\n7.\tFather Time  \t \t\n8.\tStart It Up (featuring Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie &amp; Fabolous)\n9.

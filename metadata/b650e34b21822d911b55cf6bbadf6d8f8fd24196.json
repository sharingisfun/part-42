One of the more amusing elements is the appearance of Barbara Windsor as Neil Tennant\\&amp;#039;s Aunt / Mum ! It\\&amp;#039;s definitely a must for any PSB fan who does not have it in their collection.\n\nWas ripped to MPEG-2 DVD-5 size using an Adaptec AVC-2410, and a Hi-Fi Stereo VCR (on \\&quot;soft\\&quot; picture), and then converted to DivX5 using Handbrake on OSX. \n\nThe results are quite good, but some of the beach scenes \\&quot;white out\\&quot; a bit, plus there is the usual VHS noise (for example, the black sky during the night scenes is a bit speckled). Some of you more knowledgable types may be able to clean it up by applying filters.\n\nFormat : DIVX5 (ffmpeg)\nAudio : Stereo 128kbps MP3 48khz\nDimensions : 720 x 448 25fps\n(the MPEG-2 when ripped was the usual PAL size of 720 x 576), however there were black borders top and bottom of the picture, so handbrake was set to trim them off).\n\nFor more info on this film, see the wikipedia page at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Couldn%27t_Happen_Here_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Couldn%27t_Happen_Here_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI\\&amp;#039;d like to see more video torrents in the universe have this level of technical detail with them (hint, hint...) so i can make up my mind whether to download or not!!!\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b650e34b21822d911b55cf6bbadf6d8f8fd24196","amp;dn":"Pet+Shop+Boys+-+It+Couldn%5C%27t+Happen+Here+%28PSB+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b650e34b21822d911b55cf6bbadf6d8f8fd24196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,80,227,75,33,130,45,145,27,85,207,107,186,223,109,143,143,210,65,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Then Chris, a cool guy from the football team, offers to help Ryan connect with Ashley, a popular blond. In exchange, a la Cyrano, Chris needs Ryan's help to get close to Maggie. Ryan makes the deal, helps the dastardly Chris play Maggie, takes advantage of Ashley's lack of self-esteem, loses his values, makes fun of his geeky friends, and falls in Maggie's estimation. Maggie is fooled by Chris, poised to be his next score. Before prom night is over, with its Titanic theme, will Ryan stop sinking?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e520b46d598133dde1e513804f31aa89e02e57a","amp;dn":"Whatever+it+takes+%28+2000+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e520b46d598133dde1e513804f31aa89e02e57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,82,11,70,213,152,19,61,222,30,81,56,4,243,26,168,158,2,229,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

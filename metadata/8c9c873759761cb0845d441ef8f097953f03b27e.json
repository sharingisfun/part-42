The way nature solves various problems through processes evolving during billions of years was always an inspiration to many computational paradigms; on the other hand, the complexity of the problems posed by the investigation of biological systems challenged the research of new tractable models. Molecular Computational Models: Unconventional Approaches is looking into new computational paradigms from both a theoretical perspective which offers a solid foundation of the models developed, as well as from a modeling angle, in order to reveal their effectiveness in modeling and simulating, especially biological systems. Tools and programming concepts and implementation issues are also discussed in the context of some experiments and comparative studies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9c873759761cb0845d441ef8f097953f03b27e","amp;dn":"Molecular+Computation+Models%3A+Unconventional+Approaches","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9c873759761cb0845d441ef8f097953f03b27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,156,135,55,89,118,28,176,132,93,68,30,248,240,151,149,63,3,178,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

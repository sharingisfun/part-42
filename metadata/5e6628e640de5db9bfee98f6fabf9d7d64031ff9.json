Not at all, and Mikkel Aaland shows exactly why in his excellent Shooting Digital. He shows why digital camerasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the point-and-shoot variety as well as fancier models meant for professional photographersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“are overall neither better nor worse than cameras of older design, and goes on to show you how to take advantage of their special traits. He shows how to compensate for their shortcomings, too, notably shutter lag (for which he documents a useful testing procedure) and color fringing. Though thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some coverage of creating animated GIFs, this book generally sticks to shooting time and leaves editing to other volumes.\nAaland never forgets that digital cameras should be more cameras than digital, and his book serves as an excellent photography text for hobbyists and aspiring professionals. The authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advice in this area is both technical (how to light a still life and how to best a strobe to eliminate shadows) and artistic (why kids should be encouraged to photograph other kids, and how you can use perspective to create weird effects). HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an accomplished photographer who obviously loves his work, and his enthusiasm for making art with a cameraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and, for that matter, just playing with oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“come through brilliantly. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“David Wall\nTopics covered: PhotographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“of objects, people, places, action, nature, and other subjectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“as accomplished with a modern digital camera. Emphasis falls on the relationship between camera and subject, as defined by focus, lighting, composition, and motion. Further attention goes to image manipulation accomplished via camera settings (like white balance and exposure, and, a little bit, to post-shoot processing with image software. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also nice coverage of the differences among various image file formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6628e640de5db9bfee98f6fabf9d7d64031ff9","amp;dn":"Pro+Tips+for+Taking+Great+Pictures+with+Your+Digital+Camera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6628e640de5db9bfee98f6fabf9d7d64031ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,102,40,230,64,222,93,185,191,238,152,246,250,191,157,125,100,3,31,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

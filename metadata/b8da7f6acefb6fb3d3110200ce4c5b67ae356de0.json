It&amp;#039;s a .rar with a folder inside it leading to all of the songs. Personally I thought Ten Thousand Fists was better. The singles they released are better than any of the other songs. I&amp;#039;m still a BIG fan of Disturbed, though.\n\nI will seed this for a few days, long enough for other people to seed it as well, then I&amp;#039;ll probably drop it around the time the album is actually release. Hope you guys lve it! ^_^\n\nIndestructible  4:38\nInside the Fire 3:52\nDeceiver 3:49\nThe Night 4:46\nPerfect Insanity 3:57\nHaunted 4:42\nEnough 4:20\nThe Curse 3:25\nTorn 4:09\nCriminal 4:16\nDivide 3:36\nFacade 3:45\n\nNote: They&amp;#039;re WMA as well, but to any self respecting geek it&amp;#039;s not that hard to change them to MP3, I don&amp;#039;t care otherwise.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve also edited mine to fit prettily onto WMP as the correct album, track number and the such. Maybe it will pop up in your correctly as well, dunno.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8da7f6acefb6fb3d3110200ce4c5b67ae356de0","amp;dn":"Disturbed+Indestructible+FULL+ALBUM%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8da7f6acefb6fb3d3110200ce4c5b67ae356de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,218,127,106,206,251,111,179,211,17,2,0,206,76,91,103,174,53,109,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

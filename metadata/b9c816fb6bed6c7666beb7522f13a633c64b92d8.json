It is the third single from the album Fear of the Dark, released in 1992. The song was a collaboration of singer Bruce Dickinson, and guitarist Janick Gers. The lyrics deal with the subject of loneliness brought on by sex outside the context of love.\n\nThe single was only officially released in The Netherlands, although different one-track promotional CDs exist, one for U.S. radio stations and another for Spain, which had the only vinyl version of the single.  \n\nThe single cover is the third Iron Maiden single not to feature the band's iconic mascot Eddie on the front cover (the previous examples being &quot;Running Free (live)&quot; and &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;). The cover photo alludes to the music video, which portrays a man tattooing the names of women all over his body. The song's video was directed by Samuel Bayer.\n\nThe guitar solo in &quot;Wasting Love&quot; is played by Janick Gers.\n\nThe B-side features three live tracks recorded at London's Wembley Arena on the &quot;No Prayer On The Road&quot; tour to support the No Prayer for the Dying album in 1990.  These live recordings of &quot;The Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; &amp; &quot;The Assassin&quot; are also available on a very rare Australian digi-pack (CD) version of Fear of the Dark album that was released to promote the Australian leg of the tour in 1992.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Wasting Love&quot; (Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n    &quot;Tailgunner&quot; (live - London 10/17/90) (Dickinson, Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n    &quot;Holy Smoke &quot; (live - London 10/17/90) (Dickinson, Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n    &quot;The Assassin&quot; (live - London 10/17/90) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9c816fb6bed6c7666beb7522f13a633c64b92d8","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Wasting+Love+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9c816fb6bed6c7666beb7522f13a633c64b92d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,200,22,251,107,237,108,118,102,190,183,82,47,19,166,51,198,75,146,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

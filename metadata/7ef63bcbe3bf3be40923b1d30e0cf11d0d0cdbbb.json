Metzger, though a veteran underground cartoonist (including Truckin' and several issues of Moon Dog for Print Mint), had never published a comic with Kitchen Sink Press before. But sales on Mu were poor and the only underground comic title with two letters (unless you count &quot;O.K.&quot;) ended up being Metzger's only solo effort for KSP, though he sometimes contributed to anthologies (such as Snarf #6).

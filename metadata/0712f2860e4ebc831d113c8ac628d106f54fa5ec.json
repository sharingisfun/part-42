Holladay - A Critical Introduction to the New Testament: Interpreting the Message and Meaning of Jesus Christ (Abingdon, 2005). 935 pages.\n\nShort description:\n\nNon-fundamentalist Protestant introduction to the New Testament directed primarily at grad students and seminarians. \n\nPlease note this is the text as found on the CD-ROM described below; it's considerably larger than the text of the print version.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis book introduces the New Testament in two senses: it not only provides basic literary and historical information on each of the twenty-seven writings but also orients readers to the religious, theological, and ethical issues related to the message and meaning of Jesus Christ. The overall goal is to help interested readers of the New Testament become informed, responsible interpreters of these writings and thereby enrich their personal faith and understanding.\n\nBy giving special emphasis to how the New Testament has helped shape the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity and theological outlook throughout the centuries, as well as the role it has played within the broader cultures of both East and West, this introduction also seeks to assist  readers in exercising creative, informed leadership within their own communities of faith and in bringing a deeper understanding of early Christianity to their conversations with the wider public.\n\nAlong with separate chapters devoted to each New Testament writing, there are chapters explaining how this collection of texts emerged as uniquely authoritative witnesses to the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith; why they were recognized as canonical whereas other early Christian writings were not; how the four canonical Gospels are related to one another, including a discussion of the Synoptic Problem; how the Jesus traditionÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œhis teachings, stories from his ministry, and the accounts of his suffering, death and resurrectionÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œoriginated and developed into Gospels written in narrative form; and how the Gospels relate to Jesus Christ as he was and is.\n\nAlso included is a chapter on the writings of Paul and how they emerged as a collection of authoritative texts for the church. This chapter includes a discussion of ancient letter-writing, special considerations for interpreting the Pauline writings, and PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisive influence within the history of the church and western culture.\n\nA distinctive feature of this introduction is its simultaneous publication in two versions.  There is a standard, printed version with comprehensive yet detailed coverage of each writing and supplementary chapters on related introductory questions.  There is also an expanded CD-ROM version, which gives fuller treatment (and supporting endnotes) to numerous issues introduced in the printed version; provides extensive, annotated bibliographies on each chapter; and includes additional maps, diagrams, charts, and other resources for classroom use and personal study.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCarl Holladay is Professor of New Testament at Candler School of Theology, Emory University.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0712f2860e4ebc831d113c8ac628d106f54fa5ec","amp;dn":"Carl+Holladay+-+A+Critical+Intro+to+the+New+Testament+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0712f2860e4ebc831d113c8ac628d106f54fa5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,18,242,134,14,78,188,131,29,17,60,138,198,40,209,6,245,79,165,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

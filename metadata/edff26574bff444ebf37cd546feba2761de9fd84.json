This miracle is performed in front of you as the sizzler plate is placed on your table. The dining experience thus gets an added dimension beyond taste Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is a dramatic presentation with sound, sparkle and a woosh of smoke that makes you want to laugh with delight!\n\nMany of your favourite foods can be served in this way, with a little adaptation, as I have suggested.\n\nIn this book I have given you ideas based on Indian, Continental, Chinese and Mexican dishes. They are prepared in advance, and there is usually just one main dish with interesting accompaniments that make it a 'meal-in-one' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ surely the perfect way to serve food in today's busy lifestyle.\n\nEven everyday food gets a special quality when the subtle flavour of smoke is added. The method of 'dhungar', smoking the food, is a classic tradition in gourmet dishes of Indian cuisine from many regions of India. It is also well known the world over. Bring this tradition to your table following the safe and easy steps described in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edff26574bff444ebf37cd546feba2761de9fd84","amp;dn":"Sizzlers+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edff26574bff444ebf37cd546feba2761de9fd84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,255,38,87,75,255,68,78,191,55,205,84,111,235,162,118,29,233,253,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

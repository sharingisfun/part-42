These are the &quot;kernel&quot; of Dr. Ruckman's notes on the essential verses a Bible student needs to retain his faith in the English text of the Authorized Version, to see how the scriptures interpret themselves, to learn how the AV is able by itself to correct any error or false teaching, and to reinforce the great fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith with absolute truth. In a day of relative truths (i.e., the preferences and opinions of practical atheists), may you find this omnibus of absolute truth as found in the Holy scriptures a joy.\n\nAveraging three verses per page, this volume covers Dr. Ruckman's personal study notes on about 1,200 verses that he considers to be among the most salient in the word of God. The volume of material in this one book covers all the doctrinal and theological material found in the entire Bible Believer's Commentary Series.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy scriptures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49690a0a96a3cf9f6a7749dbd6f84d1c94a1de6","amp;dn":"Ruckman%27s+Bible+References+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49690a0a96a3cf9f6a7749dbd6f84d1c94a1de6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,150,144,160,169,106,60,249,246,167,116,157,189,111,132,209,201,74,29,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

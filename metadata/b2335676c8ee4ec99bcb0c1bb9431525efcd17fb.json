But that barely tells the story of their true significance in the history of British rock &amp; roll -- including the fact that they were the first home-grown British rock &amp; roll band to dominate the U.K. charts; or that they weren't originally an instrumental group, either. The band's roots go back to Chesthunt, Hertfordshire, in early 1958, when a young Indian-born singer/guitarist named Harry Webb joined with drummer Terry Smart and guitarist Norman Mitham to form a group that they ended up calling the Drifters -- at the time, none of the records by the American R&amp;B group of the same name, founded by Clyde McPhatter, had been released in England, so they had no inkling of the name's already being used.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Dave Thompson):\n\nThe strongest of the three volumes that document the Shadows' EP output, Vol. 3 rounds up some of the band's finest-ever material -- and that includes hit singles and prized album cuts. Much of the material is drawn from the band's first years together, including several now-rare singles -- both sides of their pre-fame 45 &quot;Jet Black,&quot; plus the raucous &quot;Quartermaster's Stores,&quot; are culled from the Apache EP; further early gems &quot;Don't Be a Fool With Love,&quot; &quot;Feelin' Fine,&quot; and (from the Expresso Boingo movie soundtrack) &quot;Bongo Blues&quot; hurtle off Feelin' Fine. Elsewhere, tracks are drawn from the Guitar Tango, Shazam, Stingray, Late Night Set, volumes one and two of Dance With the Shadows, Dance On With the Shadows, Be Bop a Lula, Genie With the Light Brown Lamp, Atlantis, The Frightened City, and Chattanooga Choo Choo EPs, none of which are at all easy to locate in their original form. Indeed, for the truly dedicated collector looking to recreate the original EPs, several sets are thus completed here, and armed with a CD burner and the thumbnails of the original EP sleeves contained in the booklet, one could certainly have a lot of fun rebuilding the Shadows collection in miniature. For others, simply filling in the gaps which other Shadows compilations left open for so long is perhaps enjoyment enough.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-vol-3-r478483/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-vol-3-r478483/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000073QI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000073QI&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

Romero. We watch as he plans a three-day journey from his home in France, and chronicles his journey to the Pittsburgh area, which is to Romero as Maine is to Stephen King or Baltimore to John Waters. In those short days, he plans to seek out locations that Romero used in his films.\n\nWhile the main focus of this documentary is the original Romero trilogy of NotLD, Dawn of the Dead (1978) - which Garreau calls by its European name, Zombie - and Day of the Dead (1985), he also seeks out the Night of the Living Dead remake (1999; Romero screenplay) and even one segment of Creepshow (1982). Most likely it was time constraints that kept him from searching for the locations of Martin (1977) and The Crazies (1973), not to mention lack of said zombies.\n\nGarreau, whose musings to his hand-held camera are translated from French by a narrator, is a true fan-boy, and I use that term affectionately. He is both bemused by what is happening and the people that he meets, and giddy with excitement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in the words of Ed Grimley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like waking up Christmas morning and finding a whole fort, yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢know.\n\nThe chapters are broken up into days, with titles of the films whose locations were visited on that day. Most of this is essentially a road trip as he travels from location to location, and his honest exhilaration is catching. His giddy look at lamp posts, elevator doors, and where houses used to stand, is catching, and you just want to say, bon pour vous. When he finds the now iconic basement from the first film (nowhere near the house indicated in the film), you, the viewer, almost want someone there to high-five.\n\nThe centerpiece of the film is a trip to the Pittsburgh Comic Convention, where Garreau interviews some of the actors who played both major and minor roles in the trilogy, and then he goes on a tour of the mall in which the second film is set, led by one of the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stars, Ken Foree (who was also excellent in Stuart GordonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s From Beyond, I would like to add). This sightseeing expedition is accompanied by some of the same actors, who narrate for the fans who signed up for the tour (hell, I would have gone). The viewer can tell how much the actors (including Foree and David Emge, two of the four main leads) are enjoying not only the attention from the fans, but getting to share their experiences (e.g., Ã¢â‚¬Å“This spot is whereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). Garreau has obviously made a good impression on them, as they acknowledge him by name more than once.\n\nGarreauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive knowledge of the series is evident as he wonders through graveyards indicating the actions of a scene by the names on the stones which appear in the film. And yes, he does say the line, Ã¢â‚¬Å“TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re coming to get you BarbaraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the appropriate spot, as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure many others have. As I would.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just sorry he could not use some of the footage from the films to compare then and now (especially since the first NotLD is out of copyright and readily available), so unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan on GarreauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s level, I would recommend viewing at least the three original zombie films (68-85) before watching this. Certainly, I recognized the cemetery and mall that was central to the first two, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m less familiar with the third one, so the locations seemed less of a bonus to me (though I intend to re-watch Day of the Dead, and then watch this documentary again. As for the remake of NotLD, well, Romero was the screenplay writer, and it was directed by Tom Savini, so it seems a bit out there, but what do I know?\n\nThis is a love letter to George RomeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, and both to and for his fans. \n\n\nFAN OF THE DEAD DVD COVER\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eb9301571bd234b52958f0ebc61673edcf2dd55","amp;dn":"Fan+Of+The+Dead+2007+NTSC+DVD5+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eb9301571bd234b52958f0ebc61673edcf2dd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,185,48,21,113,189,35,75,82,149,143,14,188,97,103,62,220,242,221,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Our Modern Way series of six books has sold more than 1,000,000 copies. In an effort to provide readers with the best how-to animal books on the market we are completely updating all six Modern Way titles and reintroducing them as part of our Guide to Raising series.\n\nWritten by experts, these guides give novice and experienced livestock farmers all they need to know to successfully keep and profit from animals. Each book includes information on selection, housing, space requirements, breeding and birthing techniques, feeding, behavior, and health concerns and remedies for illness. The books also address the business of raising animals -- processing meat, milk, eggs, and more. The authors were chosen not only for their expertise but also for their ability to explain the ins and outs of animal husbandry in an inviting and authoritative manner.\n\nWhether readers are ready to start an entire herd or flock or are considering purchasing their first animal, Storey's Guide to Raising series offers vital information; each book is an indispensable reference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf0a1e4e5dc992de7b49fd7cff72d2094363767","amp;dn":"Storeys+Guide+to+Raising+Turkeys+-+Breeds+Care++Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf0a1e4e5dc992de7b49fd7cff72d2094363767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,240,161,228,229,220,153,45,231,180,159,215,207,247,45,32,148,54,55,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

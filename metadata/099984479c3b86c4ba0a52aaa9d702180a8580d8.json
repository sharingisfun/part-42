The investigation also links General David Petraeus in the chain of command to this abuse.\nFrom the summer of 2004 the Special Police Commandos were financed and equipped from a fund controlled by General Petraeus. Ret'd Colonel James Steele and Colonel James Coffman, two special forces veterans were assigned as &quot;advisors&quot; to this force, which eventually numbered over 17,000 men.\nColonel James Coffman reported to General Petraeus and described himself in an interview with the US military newspaper, Stars and Stripes as Petraeus' &quot;eyes and ears out on the ground&quot; in Iraq.\nThe Special Police Commandos came to draw most of their recruits from violent Shia militias like the Badr Brigades. The commandos who developed a fearful reputation, particularly in the Sunni community, also became involved in death squad activities.\n\n\n\nx264 720x394 @ CRF21 &amp; AAC VBR @ 112kbps &gt; MP4\n\nenglish audio and finnish subtitles included in the mp4-container\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099984479c3b86c4ba0a52aaa9d702180a8580d8","amp;dn":"Searching.for.Steele.PDTV.x264-charon.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099984479c3b86c4ba0a52aaa9d702180a8580d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,153,132,71,156,59,134,196,186,10,82,170,169,215,2,24,10,133,128,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

See, my name is Karen Memery, like memory only spelt with an e, and I'm one of the girls what works in the HÃ´tel Mon Cherie on Amity Street. HÃ´tel has a little hat over the o like that. It's French, so Beatrice tells me.&quot;\r\n\r\nSet in the late 19th centuryÂ—when the city we now call Seattle Underground was the whole town (and still on the surface), when airships plied the trade routes, would-be gold miners were heading to the gold fields of Alaska, and steam-powered mechanicals stalked the waterfront, Karen is a young woman on her own, is making the best of her orphaned state by working in Madame Damnable's high-quality bordello. Through Karen's eyes we get to know the other girls in the houseÂ—a resourceful groupÂ—and the poor and the powerful of the town. Trouble erupts one night when a badly injured girl arrives at their door, begging sanctuary, followed by the man who holds her indenture, and who has a machine that can take over anyone's mind and control their actions. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the next night brings a body dumped in their rubbish heapÂ—a streetwalker who has been brutally murdered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f3bc07d0f48aafd4354d2d92adb4b5f890eeb9","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+Bear-Karen+Memory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f3bc07d0f48aafd4354d2d92adb4b5f890eeb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,243,188,7,208,244,138,175,212,53,77,45,146,173,180,181,248,144,238,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

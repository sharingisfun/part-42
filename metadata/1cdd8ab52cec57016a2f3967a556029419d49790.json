The relationship between the formation of nanocrystal and magnetic properties is discussed in detail, which effects alloys composition and preparation process.\r\n\r\nThe experiment results verified some presumptions, and were valuable for subsequent scientific research and creating new permanent-magnet alloys.\r\n\r\nThe publication is intended for researchers, engineers and managers in the field of material science, metallurgy, and physics.\r\n\r\nProf. Shuming Pan is senior engineer of Beijing General Research Institute of Non-ferrous Metal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cdd8ab52cec57016a2f3967a556029419d49790","amp;dn":"Rare+Earth+Permanent-Magnet+Alloys%27+High+Temperature+Phase+Trans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cdd8ab52cec57016a2f3967a556029419d49790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,221,138,181,44,236,87,1,106,47,57,103,165,86,2,148,25,212,151,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

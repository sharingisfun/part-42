(Pearson, Prentice Hall)\n\nThe leading integrated chemical process design guide: Now with extensive new coverage and more process designs\n\nMore than ever, effective design is the focal point of sound chemical engineering. Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes, Fourth Edition, presents design as a creative process that integrates both the big picture and the small detailsÃ¢â‚¬â€œand knows which to stress when, and why. Realistic from start to finish, this updated edition moves readers beyond classroom exercises into open-ended, real-world process problem solving. The authors introduce integrated techniques for every facet of the discipline, from finance to operations, new plant design to existing process optimization.\n\nThis fourth edition adds new chapters introducing dynamic process simulation; advanced concepts in steady-state simulation; extensive coverage of thermodynamics packages for modeling processes containing electrolyte solutions and solids; and a concise introduction to logic control. Ã¢â‚¬Å“What You Have LearnedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ summaries have been added to each chapter, and the textÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organization has been refined for greater clarity.\n\nCoverage Includes\nConceptualization and analysis: flow diagrams, batch processing, tracing, process conditions, and product design strategies\nEconomic analysis: capital and manufacturing costs, financial calculations, and profitability analysis\nSynthesis and optimization: principles, PFD synthesis, simulation techniques, top-down and bottom-up optimization, pinch technology, and software-based control\nAdvanced steady-state simulation: goals, models, solution strategies, and sensitivity and optimization studies\nDynamic simulation: goals, development, solution methods, algorithms, and solvers\nPerformance analysis: I/O models, tools, performance curves, reactor performance, troubleshooting, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“debottleneckingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nSocietal impact: ethics, professionalism, health, safety, environmental issues, and green engineering\nInterpersonal and communication skills: improving teamwork and group effectiveness\n\nThis title draws on more than fifty years of innovative chemical engineering instruction at West Virginia University and the University of Nevada, Reno. It includes suggested curricula for single-semester and year-long design courses, case studies and practical design projects, current equipment cost data, and extensive preliminary design information that can be used as the starting point for more detailed analyses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a410f3f397e208163975414fd1cd4e4c9200f124","amp;dn":"Analysis%2C+Synthesis%2C+and+Design+of+Chemical+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a410f3f397e208163975414fd1cd4e4c9200f124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,16,243,243,151,226,8,22,57,117,65,79,209,205,78,76,146,0,241,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

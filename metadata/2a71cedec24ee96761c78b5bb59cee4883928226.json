It was formed in 1995 by ex-members of Swiz, and released three albums and a number of singles before splitting up in 2001.\n\nBluetip\\&amp;#039;s music is a fairly accessible brand of \\&amp;#039;post-hardcore\\&amp;#039; punk rock, but without the bleak introspection of many of their Dischord labelmates. Jason Farrell\\&amp;#039;s lyrics are quite often humorous and self-mocking, and there is a notable absence of political grandstanding.\n\nAfter Bluetip split up, Jason Farrell formed a new band, Retisonic.\n\nTwo albums, Join Us and Polymer, and on e.p, Hot (-) Fast (+) Union ripped in MP3 with covers ripped through iTunes 7.6.1 at 256 bit rate.\n\n\nJoin Us: Dischord #116\n\nRecorded: September 1998\nReleased: October 1998\n\nYellow Light\nCheap Rip\nJoin Us\nCastanet\nCarbon Copy\nSalinas\nF-\nI Even Drive Like A Jerk\nBad Flat\nJersey Blessed\nCold Start\nSlovakian\n\nPolymer: Dischord #121\n\nRecorded: March 2000\nReleased: September 2000\n\nPolymer \nNew Young Residents\nNew Shoe Premonition\nStereo Tinnitus\nGetting In\nMagnetified\nAstigmatic\nDon\\&amp;#039;t Punch Your Friend (for being slow)\nAnti-Bloom\nBroke the Lease\n\nHot (-) Fast (+) Union: Slowdime Records #sd29\n\nThis is a 5-song EP released in 2000 on Slowdime (missing 5th song, Anti-Pope)\n\nHot Fast Union\nSpit Up Kid\nPersistent\nCompliment The Negative\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a71cedec24ee96761c78b5bb59cee4883928226","amp;dn":"Bluetip%2C+2+albums+and+1+e.p.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a71cedec24ee96761c78b5bb59cee4883928226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,113,206,222,194,78,233,103,97,199,139,91,181,156,238,72,131,146,130,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

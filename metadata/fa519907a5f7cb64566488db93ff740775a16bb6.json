These conversations\ncentered on the emerging threat to human\nvalues posed by ISIS and other groups. As a\nconsequence my eyes have been opened wide\nto the bracing capacity of radical jihadists to\nengage in human savagery. Once exposed to\nevidence of brutality that includes the deliberate\nshooting of babies in the presence of their mothers, the rape of women who were\nthen told that the only way to redeem their\nhonor was to blow themselves up as suicide\nbombers, and the summary decapitation of\nmen, women, and children when they failed\nto comply with conversion edicts issued by\nCaliph Ibrahim, the leader of the Islamic\nState, it becomes impossible to remain silent.\nGiven that ISIS poses an existential threat\nto a number of countries, including Israel,\nand representing a growing menace to lives\nof Yazidis, moderate Sunni Muslims, Shia\nMuslims, Kurds, Christians, and Jews, it is\nhighly doubtful that anyone but the most\nnaÃƒÂ¯ve among us would believe that negotiations,\nled by the United Nations or anyone\nelse, are the proper way forward. Instead,\nreaders of this new book by Jay Sekulow and his team will discover that evil such as this\nmust be met with force. Nothing else will do.\nSekulow describes the origins of ISIS and its\nideological links to other jihadists, and clarifies\n1) the fractured relationship between\nISIS, a radical jihadist group that was founded\nin Iraq and Syria and has directed its efforts\ntoward the creation of an Islamic caliphate,\nand al-Qaeda, which has oriented its\nterrorist attacks against Western and Arab\ngovernments, horrifically exemplified by the\nevents of September 11, 2001; 2) the breathtakingly\nrapid advance of ISIS in Iraq, fueled\nby its striking commitment to terror, a development\nthat has been fostered by the bewildering\ncourage deficit of the Iraqi military\nforces; 3) the ideological and visionary links\nbetween ISIS and Hamas that combine to threaten IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence; and 4) substantial\nevidence revealing how radical jihadist\ngroups like ISIS pose a mounting threat to\nthe American people. Adding urgency to\nSekulowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s analysis, a U.S. senator recently\nexplained how radical jihadists have collected\nthe components necessary to assemble a\nbomb to Ã¢â‚¬Å“blow upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a U.S. city. \n\n         Harry G.

Be aware that the KeyGen needs Visual C++ Redistributable to work.

The software easily recovers data from hard disks, digital cameras, and any type of storage media - flash drives, USB drives, memory stick, PC card, multimedia card, secure digital card and diskette.\n\nThis package contains a first Portable version built using RunHiddenConsole.exe to start the Batch file that changes some values in Registry, runs the program and deletes the Registry values when exiting from the program. This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7afb68a373bb9ef5c1c94d80a43a7a6f55d51b5","amp;dn":"Smart+Data+Recovery+4.1+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7afb68a373bb9ef5c1c94d80a43a7a6f55d51b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,175,182,138,55,59,185,239,92,28,148,216,10,67,167,166,245,93,81,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

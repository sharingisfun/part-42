Another equally mysterious wave of extinctions affected large Caribbean islands around 5,000 years ago. The coupling of these extinctions with the earliest appearance of human beings has led to the suggestion that foraging humans are to blame, although major climatic shifts were also taking place in the Americas during some of the extinctions. The last published volume with similar (but not identical) themes -- Extinctions in Near Time -- appeared in 1999; since then a great deal of innovative, exciting new research has been done but has not yet been compiled and summarized. Different chapters in this volume provide in-depth resumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of the chronology of the extinctions in North and South America, the possible insights into animal ecology provided by studies of stable isotopes and anatomical/physiological characteristics such as growth increments in mammoth and mastodont tusks, the clues from taphonomic research about large-mammal biology, the applications of dating methods to the extinctions debate, and archeological controversies concerning human hunting of large mammals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca41c6ecbba2a7a69c42de134a28e0c753476261","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+American+Megafaunal+Extinctions+at+the+End+of+the+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca41c6ecbba2a7a69c42de134a28e0c753476261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,65,198,236,187,162,167,166,156,66,222,19,74,40,224,199,83,71,98,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

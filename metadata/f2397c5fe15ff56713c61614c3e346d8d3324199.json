And although I certainly don't mind investing the effort to gather and create the discography, it is a little disheartening when, in some cases after only 24 hours or less, the discography dies because nobody who downloaded it bothered to stay around to seed/support it.\n\nTo anyone wanting to rejuvenate an old discography of mine, but perhaps don't know how, here's a quick walk through...  (1) find the torrent you want to share (2) make a copy of your previously downloaded folder.  I suggest making a duplicate copy to ensure nothing happens to your original.  (3) click on, and download the dot torrent file  (4) rename the copied folder to the same file name as the dot torrent file you just downloaded.  So, for example, your copied folder might simply be called &quot;33 Miles&quot;, where as the dot torrent file was called &quot;33 Miles Discography 2007-2010 (3 Releases)&quot;  (5) open your torrent client  (6) within your client, now open that dot torrent file you downloaded in Step #3 above  (7) your client will think you are a downloader so it will ask you where you want to save the music to.  Point it to the location where you performed Step #2.  Your client will then realize you already have the songs, and you will become a seeder.\n\nThank you for helping.  :)\n\nOnto this 17th bundle, I was able to find three specific requests of DJ Cookie, John Elefante, and Sweet Comfort Band.  So to the three people who asked for those, enjoy.  To everyone else, God Bless!\n\nWe're now up to 469 releases for 2013.\n\nThis 17th bundle includes the following 25 titles...\n\n * Altars - 2013 - Something More\n * Amy Grant - 2013 - How Mercy Looks From Here - Deluxe Edition\n * Backstage Royalty - 2013 - The Indestructibles - Single\n * Bobby McFerrin - 2013 - Spirityouall\n * Chris Taylor - 2013 - How Sweet Is Your Name - Single\n * City Lights - 2013 - From Basements To Skyscrapers\n * DC Talk - 2013 - Free At Last - Remastered\n * DC Talk - 2013 - Jesus Freak - Remastered\n * DC Talk - 2013 - Supernatural - Remastered\n * DJ Cookie - 2013 - Third Day-Audio A-TobyMac Remix - Single\n * God's Love For Hardcore - 2013 - Goes Undercover\n * Govenor Reiss - 2013 - Mercy Grace Favor\n * Hammock - 2013 - EP's Singles And Remixes\n * IllumiNate - 2013 - IllumiNate The World\n * J Prophet - 2013 - I Got Bread EP\n * Jellyrox, The - 2013 - Embellish EP\n * John Elefante - 2013 - On My Way To The Sun\n * John Tibbs - 2013 - Live B-Sides\n * PJ Morton - 2013 - New Orleans\n * Redd Lettaz - 2013 - The Refocusing\n * Still Trill Christians - 2013 - Before The Throne\n * Sweet Comfort Band - 2013 - The Waiting Is Over\n * This City Awaits - 2013 - Said The Liar\n * True Story - 2013 - More Than A Melody EP\n * Whosoever South - 2013 - Where We From - Single\n\nFor His Glory,\nTorrentTracts - May 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2397c5fe15ff56713c61614c3e346d8d3324199","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+17%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2397c5fe15ff56713c61614c3e346d8d3324199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,57,124,95,225,95,245,103,19,198,22,20,195,227,70,216,211,50,65,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

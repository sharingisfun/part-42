Hall \n\n\nDISCOVER THE SECRETS OF WHAT MAKES A MEGA-BESTSELLER IN THIS ENTERTAINING, REVELATORY GUIDE\n\nWhat do Michael Corleone, Jack Ryan, and Scout Finch have in common? Creative writing professor and thriller writer James W. Hall knows. Now, in this entertaining, revelatory book, he reveals how bestsellers work, using twelve twentieth-century blockbusters as case studiesÃ¢â‚¬â€including The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Jaws. From tempting glimpses inside secret societies, such as submariners in The Hunt for Red October, and Opus Dei in The Da Vinci Code, to vivid representations of the American Dream and its oppositeÃ¢â‚¬â€the American NightmareÃ¢â‚¬â€in novels like The Firm and The Dead Zone, Hall identifies the common features of mega-bestsellers. Including fascinating and little-known facts about some of the most beloved books of the last century, Hit Lit is a must-read for fiction lovers and aspiring writers alike, and makes us think anew about why we love the books we love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33eec4b58e9b7e363255b6b9c2e1cedc2c915182","amp;dn":"Hit+Lit%3A+Cracking+the+Code+of+the+Twentieth+Century%27s+Biggest+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33eec4b58e9b7e363255b6b9c2e1cedc2c915182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,238,196,181,142,155,126,54,50,85,182,185,194,225,206,220,44,145,81,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

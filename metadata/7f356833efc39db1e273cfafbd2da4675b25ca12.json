The song was written by Perry, Lukasz &quot;Dr. Luke&quot; Gottwald, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, and Henry &quot;Cirkut&quot; Walter.&quot;Roar&quot; is a midtempo power pop song. The song made its radio debut on August 10, 2013 and was released onto iTunes, YouTube, and Amazon two days later. A lyric video was released the same day as its iTunes release. &quot;Roar&quot; has garnered positive reviews from music critics, some of whom compared it to her 2010 single &quot;Firework&quot;. Others compared the song to Sara Bareilles's 2013 single &quot;Brave&quot;. On September 4, 2013 &quot;Roar&quot; reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.The music video begins with a painted jungle and the word &quot;ROAR&quot; flashing off the screen. The video than changes to life action showing a scene of an air crash in the middle of a jungle. Katy stumbles out of the wreckage with disheveled clothes. Her love interest is seen taking a selfie using a smart phone. Night falls, while walking with her love interest through the jungle a tiger suddenly appears and mauls him. Katy screams and flees the area arriving near a stream. When she washed her face at the side of the river, an alligator pops out frightening her. She is then surrounded by pairs of glowing eyes which turned out to be fireflies filling the area as she sings the chorus. Looking at her reflection in the water which changes into an image of a tiger, the fireflies then form an image of a roaring tiger behind. The next day, she fashions a spear using a spear and uses it to get a banana for a new monkey pal. She then takes a shower with the help of an elephant and brushes an alligators teeth. Katy then stumbles into a cave , where a cave painting depicts a human trying to hunt a tiger. The tiger then frightens the human off, as well as deflects the arrows thrown by the group humans. She then exits the cave and stands by an adjacent waterfall overlooking the jungle. Katy then swings using a vine from one and to the other and views the jungle from a tree. During the second chorus, she is seen making a weapon which she used to trap the tiger after luring it. The two face off with Katy emerging victorious, calming the tiger. She is then seen sitting on her throne that is made out of leaves accompanied by jungle animals. In another scene, Katy is seen taking selfies with her monkey pal. She is also painting an elephant's toenails in another interlaced scene. After the song ends, Katy wakes up on the plane, and steps out into the jungle. The scene freezes, returns to a painted effect, and the music video ends.The music video was filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia, California, which has been used since the 1930s by Hollywood filmmakers in need of a jungle-like location.\n\nMEDIA INFO\n\nVIDEO\n\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;94dcfdf3fcd4d8a1baa4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 6 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 4mn 29s\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 800 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.036\nWriting library                          : x264 core 120\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\nColor primaries                          : BT.709\nTransfer characteristics                 : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients                      : BT.709\n\nAUDIO\n\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 4mn 29s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nSUBS-TEXT\n\nID                                       : 3\nFormat                                   : UTF-8\nCodec ID                                 : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info                            : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : No\nForced                                   : No\n\nTHUMBNAILS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/1zaN2ORY/1378488098_thumbnails.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/1zaN2ORY/1378488098_thumbnails.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes:\n\n* Recommended to use latest version VLC Media Player.\n* Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).\n* Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.\n\nEncoder Notes: Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide DVDScr, R5, DVDRips, BluRay, Direct Audio, Early Music\nReleases, Seedboxes, Links, Dedicated Servers anything u can provide, Advance / Promo CDs/DVDs.

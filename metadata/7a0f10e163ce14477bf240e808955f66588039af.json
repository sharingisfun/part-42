The New York Times described her as &quot;far and away, [America's] best-selling poet&quot;.\n\nOliver has also been compared to Emily Dickinson, with whom she shares an affinity for solitude and interior monologues. Her poetry combines dark introspection with joyous release. Although she has been criticized for writing poetry that assumes a dangerously close relationship of women with nature, she finds the self is only strengthened through an immersion with nature. Oliver is also known for her unadorned language and accessible themes. The Harvard Review describes her work as an antidote to &quot;inattention and the baroque conventions of our social and professional lives. She is a poet of wisdom and generosity whose vision allows us to look intimately at a world not of our making.&quot;\n\nMaxine Kumin describes Mary Oliver in the Women's Review of Books as an &quot;indefatigable guide to the natural world, particularly to its lesser-known aspects.&quot; Reviewing Dream Work for The Nation, critic Alicia Ostriker numbered Oliver among America's finest poets: &quot;visionary as Emerson [... she is] among the few American poets who can describe and transmit ecstasy, while retaining a practical awareness of the world as one of predators and prey.&quot; New York Times reviewer Bruce Bennet stated that the Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning collection American Primitive, &quot;insists on the primacy of the physical&quot; while Holly Prado of Los Angeles Times Book Review noted that it &quot;touches a vitality in the familiar that invests it with a fresh intensity.&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* A Thousand Mornings\n\n* Dog Songs\n\n* House of Light\n\n* Owls and Other Fantasies: poems and essays\n\n* Red Bird\n\n* Swan: Poems and Prose Poems\n\n* The Truro Bear and Other Adventures: Poems and Essays\n\n* West Wind: Poems and Prose Poems\n\n* Winter Hours: Prose, Prose Poems, and Poems\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/books/mary-olivers-dog-songs-finds-poetry-in-friends.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/books/mary-olivers-dog-songs-finds-poetry-in-friends.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/mary-oliver/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/mary-oliver/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a0f10e163ce14477bf240e808955f66588039af","amp;dn":"Mary+Oliver+-+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Prose+%289+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a0f10e163ce14477bf240e808955f66588039af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,15,16,225,99,206,20,71,123,242,64,232,8,149,95,102,88,128,57,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

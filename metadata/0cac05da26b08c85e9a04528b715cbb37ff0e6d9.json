And so Boyle argues that, just as every informed citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or civil rights, every citizen in the information age should also have an understanding of intellectual property law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cac05da26b08c85e9a04528b715cbb37ff0e6d9","amp;dn":"James+Boyle+-+The+Public+Domain+lectures-ebooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cac05da26b08c85e9a04528b715cbb37ff0e6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,172,5,218,38,176,140,133,233,160,69,40,183,21,203,179,127,240,230,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

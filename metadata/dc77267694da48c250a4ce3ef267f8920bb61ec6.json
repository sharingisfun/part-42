It only got one season, but should have gotten so many more.\n\nAnyway, this is the TV-show, the movie, the comic book and the soundtrack from the TV-show.\n\nI advise you to look at it in this order: TV-show, comic book, movie. That fits the timeline.\n\nThere are no subtitles because I don&amp;#039;t know how to sync them to the video, and that&amp;#039;s even worse than not understanding the Asian (japanese?) profanities in the show.\n\nI will seed this to 400% and that&amp;#039;s it. Got too slow a line and too much to share to keep it alive for longer than that.\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as I do, especially the theme song on the TV-show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc77267694da48c250a4ce3ef267f8920bb61ec6","amp;dn":"Firefly_Complete_Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc77267694da48c250a4ce3ef267f8920bb61ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,119,38,118,148,218,72,194,80,164,206,62,242,103,248,146,11,182,30,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

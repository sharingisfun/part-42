As you'd guess from the &quot;69&quot; in the title, most of the tracks here are from the final years of the group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mostly numbers from Let It Be,plus some solo tunes too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ opened up and given a whole new sort of energy here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ showing the rich inspiration the fab four were still able to provide, even at the end! Beatles music has been a crucial influence on Brazil, from the 60s Jovem Guarda and Tropicalia scenes onward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the work here really shows the range of influences, extrapolated through really creative instrumentation, vocal arrangements, and production techniques. The whole thing's hardly another &quot;tribute to&quot; session Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and instead is more like an extended poem inspired by the work of John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Titles on this first volume include &quot;Dig It&quot; by Astronauta Pingium, &quot;Let It Be&quot; by Ivan Lins, &quot;Two Of Us&quot; by Leoni &amp; Leo Jaime, &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; by Biquini Cavadao, &quot;Across The Universe&quot; by Rodrigo Santos, &quot;Paul's Piano Intro&quot; by Vitor Araujo, &quot;Let IT Down&quot; by Maria Gadu, &quot;Wah Wah&quot; by Tortu with Sergio Dias, and &quot;The Long &amp; Winding Road&quot; by Raimundo Fagner.

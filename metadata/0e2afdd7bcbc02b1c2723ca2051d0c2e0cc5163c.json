She falls in love with a journalist named Marcos (Antonio Banderas). After a brutal rape and several murders later, she finds herself on the run with Marcos chasing after her.\n\nThe story would have you believe that this is a typical Rape/ Revenge flick where the rape occurs early on and the rest of the film is the woman seeking vengeance. But the rape doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t occur until 40 minutes in giving the viewers plenty of time to get to know Ana and like her character. She looks like Rachel Weisz and is quite impulsive and quirky. Her character is very likeable and you will find her emotionally honest even when she is lying. This will make watching her downfall a little difficult to bear.\n\nYou watch Ana fall in love with Marcos, make love with him, and then you see the excitement in her eyes when she runs to her door one fateful night expecting Marcos on the other side. The gang rape is brutal, but most of the violence (outside of the rape) is implied. The revenge part takes place very soon after. The rest of the film is Ana and Marcos trying to reach each other one last time, making several mistakes along the way, and a very climactic reunion at the end.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108670/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108670/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2afdd7bcbc02b1c2723ca2051d0c2e0cc5163c","amp;dn":"Dispara.1993.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e2afdd7bcbc02b1c2723ca2051d0c2e0cc5163c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,42,253,215,188,188,2,177,194,114,60,162,5,29,12,46,12,197,22,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

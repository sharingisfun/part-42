Released in February 2014, it was Vega's first album of new material in seven years. The album features contributions from Larry Campbell, Peter Gabriel and Tony Levin (bassist from King Crimson). Although Vega's music had been sampled by various artists in the past, the album contains Vega's first own attempt at sampling with the track &quot;Don't Uncork What You Can't Contain&quot; including elements from 50 Cent's 2005 song &quot;Candy Shop&quot;.[5]  The album entered the UK Album Chart at #37, the first time one of Vega's studio albums had reached the UK Top 40 since 1992. It received generally favourable reviews.[6]  The album appeared under Vega's own label, Amanuensis Productions, and was distributed in Europe by Cooking Vinyl and in North America by Aimee Mann's label Superego.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Crack In The Wall\n[02] Fool's Complaint\n[03] I Never Wear White\n[04] Portrait Of The Knight Of Wands\n[05] Don't Uncork What You Can't Contain\n[06] Jacob And The Angel\n[07] Silver Bridge\n[08] Song Of The Stoic\n[09] Laying On Of Hands / Stoic 2\n[10] Horizon (There Is A Road)\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:36m:40s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 243mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................

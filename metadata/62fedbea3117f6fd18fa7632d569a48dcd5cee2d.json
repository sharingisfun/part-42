But our evolutionary biochemistry tells us to favour those we are close to. Can we expect to be fair in our dealings when it goes against our makeup?\n\n[u]Fair, Fairer, Fairest?[/u]\n\nWe want things to be &quot;fair&quot;. We want all individuals to be deserving of similar treatment. But that runs in the face of the fact that most human beings tend to naturally favour family and kin. Is it healthy for society to promulgate ideas which do not jibe with the evolutionary underpinnings of human psychology?\n\n[u]Guests:[/u]\n\n[b]Stephen Asma[/b] - Author, &quot;Against Fairness&quot;\n\n[b]Sylvia Bashevkin[/b] - Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Toronto\n\t\n[b]Clifford Orwin[/b] - Professor of Political Science, University of Toronto\n\n[b]Jordan Peterson[/b] - Professor of Psychology, University of Toronto\n\t\n[b]Joseph Heath[/b] - Director, Centre for Ethics, University of Toronto\n\nFor more information on this episode, including information on the guests and various other resources and links, visit the episode webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theagenda.tvo.org/episode/189599/to-be-fair...&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theagenda.tvo.org/episode/189599/to-be-fair...&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nNote:  This is an iPod video podcast that is available for free download from the website.

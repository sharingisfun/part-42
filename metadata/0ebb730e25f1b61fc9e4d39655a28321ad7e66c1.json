The Ã¢â‚¬Å“HardwiredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ compilation features past bangers from the likes of Joker, Champion, Bok Bok and Royal-T as well as a special set of previously unreleased material from Kode 9, Falty DL,  Zed Bias, Swindle, D.O.K and PJam amongst others. The tunes range from the more tropical styled garage percussions to bare instrumental tunes, altogether making a really harmonious group of productions to hit the dance-floors with.\n\nSome highlight tracks that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found myself going back to quite a bit would be the eight minute Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arizona Skyz VIPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from PJam which covers all grounds going from a garage-to-jungle tempo (making it a wicked DJ tool). Kode 9Ã¢â‚¬Ëœs appearance on the tracklisting (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IceÃ¢â‚¬Å“) definitely caught my ear and, as suspected, took me to an extremely dark place with the minimalist structure and crunching sounds of the track and FaltyDL also takes a stab at Terror DanjahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zumpi HuntahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ giving it a funked-up garage flavour. Stay FreshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Swifta Beater is also in the track-listing, a producer who made major waves this year in Grime,  with an absolutely beautifully crafted instrumental with an aggressive synth keeping it flowing (Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoveÃ¢â‚¬Å“). To be honest, every one of these tracks will surely be heard in mixes to come in the year, if not already.\n\nThe compilation attests to GrimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and gives a good look at the future of the much growing popularity of the genre.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/hardrive-presents-hardwired/id609917742&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/hardrive-presents-hardwired/id609917742&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ebb730e25f1b61fc9e4d39655a28321ad7e66c1","amp;dn":"VA+-+Hardrive+presents+Hardwired+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ebb730e25f1b61fc9e4d39655a28321ad7e66c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,187,115,14,37,241,182,31,201,228,211,150,85,162,131,33,173,126,102,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The complex chemical processes of extracting various elements through hydrometallurgical, pyrometallurgical or electrometallurgical operations are explained.\r\nIn the choice of material for this work, the author made good use of the synergy of scientific principles and industrial practices, offering the much needed and hitherto unavailable combination of detailed treatises on both compiled in one book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24c4ab8bed0481a5d021d9c72443d02bd3c75ce","amp;dn":"Chemical+Metallurgy+Principles+and+Practice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24c4ab8bed0481a5d021d9c72443d02bd3c75ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,76,74,184,190,208,72,26,93,2,29,156,114,68,61,2,189,60,117,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is ancient, reaching back to the Buddha's very first discourse, and it is highly venerated as a unique treasury of wisdom and practical guidance. The teaching of the Eightfold Path challenges us to grasp the implications of that vision, and asks us to transform ourselves in its light. Like the teaching itself, this work covers every aspect of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f457dbe634bb1294d65d36aa79444dd5d787d750","amp;dn":"Sangharaskhita+-+Buddha%27s+Noble+Eightfold+Path","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f457dbe634bb1294d65d36aa79444dd5d787d750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,87,219,230,52,187,18,148,214,93,54,170,121,68,77,213,215,135,215,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

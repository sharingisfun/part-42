The influence of Richard Thompson is felt throughout, especially in the often vinegary tone of Gregson's Stratocaster, but Gregson's writing is mature, self-assured, and original enough to keep that influence from becoming overwhelming. The bluesy &quot;I Wouldn't Treat a Dog&quot; bumps up nicely against the shimmery and hook-laden folk-pop of &quot;Everybody Cheats on You,&quot; while Thompson is probably owed royalties for &quot;That Same Mistake.&quot; That's the beginning of the album, and then things get a bit spottier. The slide guitar on &quot;This Tender Trap&quot; lends an air of Delta blues to a song whose chord progression is half Tin Pan Alley and half Brill Building, and the result is more puzzling than involving; &quot;I Specialize&quot; combines an awkward lyrical refrain with an awkward chord progression, to predictable effect. But brilliant moments outnumber disappointing ones by about two to one, making this album a solid investment for any fan of British folk-rock.

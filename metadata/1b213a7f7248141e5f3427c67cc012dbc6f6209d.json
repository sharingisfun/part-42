Their foundation always remained icy, droning post-punk, replete with sludgy, murky guitars and mumbled Ian Curtis-style vocals. However, as the Lorries evolved, they gradually sprinkled in elements of industrial dance, early rave music, and spaghetti Western soundtracks, as well as liberal doses of inventive, acid-tinged guitar work. Taking their name from a British tongue twister, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry was formed in Leeds in late 1981 by guitarist/songwriter Chris Reed and vocalist Mark Sweeney. Reed and Sweeney had previously performed in the local bands Radio Id and Knife Edge, respectively, and added a rhythm section of bassist Steve Smith and drummer Mick Brown. Sweeney left within a year, however, and Reed took over lead vocal duties, with Martin Fagan coming onboard as a second guitarist.\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.87% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCherry Red\nCatalog:\t\tCD MRED 167\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Beating My Head\n02.He's Read\n03.Monkeys On Juice\n04.Talk About The Weather\n05.Hand On Heart\n06.Feel A Piece\n07.Hollow Eyes\n08.Strange Dream\n09.Chance\n10.Spinning Round\n11.Last Train\n12.Mescal Dance\n13.Blitz\n14.Walking On Your Hands\n15.Cut Down\n16.Crawling Mantra\n17.Nothing Wrong\n18.Only Dreaming\n19.She Said\n20.Open Up\n21.Heaven\n22.You Are Everything\n23.Blow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b213a7f7248141e5f3427c67cc012dbc6f6209d","amp;dn":"Very+Best+Of+Red+Lorry+Yellow+Lorry+%282000%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b213a7f7248141e5f3427c67cc012dbc6f6209d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,33,58,127,114,72,20,30,95,52,39,198,124,192,18,219,198,246,32,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

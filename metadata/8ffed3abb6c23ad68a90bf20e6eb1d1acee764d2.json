However, he wasn't officially part of the band when the album package was designed, so he doesn't appear in the cover photos and is listed as a guest musician.\n\nThe song &quot;Can You Understand?&quot; uses a quote from &quot;Tonya and Yuri Arrive at Varykino&quot;, a theme from Maurice Jarre's score for Doctor Zhivago.[2] According to David Samuel Barr, a friend of the band who wrote the liner notes for the Tales of 1001 Nights compilation, Dunford had thought this melody to be a public domain Russian folk tune.[3] Because of confusion over the Jarre quote, some live collections (including Live at the Royal Albert HallÃ‚Â : King Biscuit Flower Hour Vol. 1[4] and some unauthorized releases) mistakenly credit &quot;Can You Understand?&quot; entirely to Jarre.\n\nThe song &quot;On the Frontier&quot; was previously released (also in 1973) by former Renaissance member Jim McCarty's band Shoot. It was the title track of their only album.[5]\n\nThe lyrics for &quot;Carpet of the Sun&quot; printed on the LP's inner sleeve included an extra verse which is not sung on the recording. The verse begins with &quot;Come along and try, looking into ways of giving. Maybe we will try, find a dream that we will live in&quot;.\n\nIt was the band's first album to make the Billboard 200 album chart, peaking at #171.\n\nFLAC\n\nRenaissance\n\nAshes Are Burning\n\n1973 \n\nCD - No Artwork\n\n&quot;Can You Understand?&quot; - 9:51\n&quot;Let It Grow&quot; - 4:14\n&quot;On the Frontier&quot; (McCarty-Thatcher) - 4:55\n&quot;Carpet of the Sun&quot; - 3:31\n&quot;At the Harbour&quot; - 6:48\n&quot;Ashes Are Burning&quot; - 11:20","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffed3abb6c23ad68a90bf20e6eb1d1acee764d2","amp;dn":"Renaissance+-+Ashes+Are+Burning+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffed3abb6c23ad68a90bf20e6eb1d1acee764d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,254,211,171,182,194,58,214,138,144,191,32,230,235,29,26,206,231,100,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

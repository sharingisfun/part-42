Z. Guest and Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, polo champion and heir to the Phipps steel fortune, Cornelia Guest resisted eating animal products from childhood because of her passion for â€œcritters.â€ When her mother became ill, her research compelled her to take the leap to eat cruelty-free.\r\nIn Cornelia Guestâ€™s Simple Pleasures, she reveals the secrets of understated elegance she learned from her parents and the familyâ€™s extraordinary friends. Her favorite simple recipes are so delicious, even the most fervent carnivores do not miss the meat, and her tips on entertaining take the stress out of any event. Her ulterior motive is to inspire readers to have fun experimenting with healthy alternatives and to change the way they think about food.\r\n\r\nShe shows readers how to incorporate affordable, cruelty-free eating into their daily lives and how to serve that wholesome food to friends. Organized by season, each section begins with a luscious mealâ€”a light spring lunch of chilled asparagus soup and quinoa salad, an alfresco summer dinner of veggie carpaccio and stuffed squash blossoms, a fall breakfast buffet of pecan waffles, faux buttermilk pancakes, and raspberry muffins, and a cozy winterâ€™s dinner of shepherdâ€™s pie with a chocolate tart for dessert. Each season contains recipes for beverages, soups, salads, pasta, side dishes, main courses, and an abundance of desserts that everyone will love. Special sections feature recipes for grains, greens, and beans. Her favorite chefs, doctors, a veterinarian, and other health experts have contributed sidebars with tips, advice, and eye-opening information.\r\n\r\nDismissing fussy food and pretention, she believes the key to entertaining well is simplicity. Cornelia Guestâ€™s Simple Pleasures is filled with advice on how to set a lively and original table, how to bring nature inside, even how to stay calm in the face of entertaining disasters. She shows how a little thought and effort makes it a snap to create a relaxed, warm atmosphere and fabulous food free of animal products that will not only please family and friends but will also allow you to enjoy your own party.\r\n\r\nRichly illustrated with photographs of personal memorabilia and of Templeton, her legendary home, the book captures the feeling of a well-lived life. Cheerful, colorful, and unpretentious, Simple Pleasures will give readers all they need to know to cook in the most nutritious way possible and to serve it up with great style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d6ac37d8e8313c0b2d588e68c08e850e7f5ea7","amp;dn":"Cornelia+Guest%27s+Simple+Pleasures+%282012%29+%28Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d6ac37d8e8313c0b2d588e68c08e850e7f5ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,214,172,55,216,232,49,60,11,45,88,142,104,192,142,133,14,127,94,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

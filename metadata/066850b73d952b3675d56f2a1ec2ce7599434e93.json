I got it off UTUBE and took out the audio as it was a little crappy and put a 24bit cd rip of the song in their and made the video wide screen 720 x 480 and ran a couple of filters to improve it a bit.\n\nI suspect b4 it was uploaded it was probably better quality video and sound.\n\nNow the sound is cd quality and the video quite good considering I got it off UTUBE a year ago.\n\nIf anyone knows where I can get the original,  LEAVE ME A MESSAGE PLEASE.\n\nAnyway enjoy even even if you are not a Dr Who fan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066850b73d952b3675d56f2a1ec2ce7599434e93","amp;dn":"Moonlight+Shadow_Dr+Who+rose+Theme_Garfiel.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066850b73d952b3675d56f2a1ec2ce7599434e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,104,80,183,61,149,43,54,117,213,111,42,30,194,206,117,153,67,78,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

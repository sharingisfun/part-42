Everything can be controlled with your mouse, so there's no problem if you're not into coding too much.\n\nThe application supports most things you usually see on the Internet such as forms, banners, Flash video players, captchas, images, buttons, YouTube content, photo galleries and so much more.\n\nOf course, it all comes down to the users and their needs because WYSIWYG Web Builder can rise up to the expectations and help in any regard, as long as it's addressed to web designing.\n\nThe interesting thing is that the program even comes with PayPal eCommerce integration, which means you can place a Buy Now button on your website, or all the other PayPal utilities, such as View Cart, Subscription, Donation and Add to Cart.\n\nJust as expected, since we are talking about a rather powerful application, there are a lot of other handy tools in there, such as the page weight viewer to see the size of the page elements, sitemaps, link checker, search index and extension manager.\n\nThat being said, WYSIWYG Web Builder is certainly a product that is worth trying. The strong feature pack and the ease of use make this software suited for all users and the output meets modern standards, so it may very well be considered one of the top picks in its category.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 8 / Windows 7 / Vista / XP\n\nHomepage: http://www.wysiwygwebbuilder.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a49d9a0eef544547f479d4cb60e06a4c9d659dfd","amp;dn":"WYSIWYG+Web+Builder+v8.5.6+%282-click+run%29%28registred%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a49d9a0eef544547f479d4cb60e06a4c9d659dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,157,154,14,239,84,69,71,244,121,212,203,96,224,106,76,157,101,157,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

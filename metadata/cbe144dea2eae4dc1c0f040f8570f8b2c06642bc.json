By flickering firelight, they drew bison, deer, and mammoths on cavern walls- vibrant images that seize our imaginations after thirty thousand years. They are known to archaeologists as the Cro-Magnons-but who were they? Simply put, these people were among the first anatomically modern humans. For millennia, their hunter-gatherer culture flourished in small pockets across Ice Age Europe, the distant forerunner to the civilization we live in now.\n\n\nBestselling author Brian Fagan brings these early humans out of the deep freeze with his trademark mix of erudition, cutting-edge science, and vivid storytelling. Cro-Magnon reveals human society in its infancy, facing enormous environmental challenges from glaciers, predators, and a rival species of humans-the Neanderthals. Cro-Magnon captures the adaptability that has made humans an unmatched success as a species. Living on a frozen continent with only crude tools, Ice Age humans survived and thrived. In these pages, we meet our most remarkable ancestors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbe144dea2eae4dc1c0f040f8570f8b2c06642bc","amp;dn":"Cro-Magnon+-+How+the+Ice+Age+Gave+Birth+to+the+First+Modern+Huma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbe144dea2eae4dc1c0f040f8570f8b2c06642bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,225,68,222,162,234,228,220,28,15,4,15,133,112,248,178,192,102,66,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It includes additional conceptual results, implementation of the FRRPP process in emulsion media to produce various block copolymers, and other FRRPP-related supplementary topics. Conceptual topics include the application of the quantitative analysis presented in the first FRRPP monograph for the occurrence of the FRRPP process to the polysterene-styrene-ether (PS-S-Ether) and poly(methacrylic acid)-methacrylic acid-water (PMAA-MAA-Water) systems, as well as extensions through unsteady state analysis of the occurrence of flat temperature profiles. Also, the generalization of the quantitative analysis is done to consider molecular weight effects, especially based on changes of the phase envelope to an hourglass type.

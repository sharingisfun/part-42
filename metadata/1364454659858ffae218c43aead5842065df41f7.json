We also hear what Jesse Ventura has to say about Ebola, learn about a Brooklyn teacher facing 36 counts of kidnapping and criminal sex against minors, a teacher from Louisiana arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a student, and then the glorious callers chime in. Ant tells us about a woman suing a sperm bank for being inseminated by a black donor, he pitches us a charitable idea called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Feels For Meals,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we are introduced to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Japanese Bobo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ watch a Japanese game show, and we see Ã¢â‚¬Å“tough girlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and never want to see it again. The show ends with us enduring a call from Lady Trucker and Lady Di, talking about rapey porn, and chatting about message boards.

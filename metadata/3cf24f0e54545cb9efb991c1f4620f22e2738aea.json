Unfortunately, it can and often does! O&amp;O DiskImage lets you create images of your entire computer or individual partitions while you work. If data loss occurs, your imaged data (files, folders, partitions) can be restored in no time at all ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ even if Windows is unable to start!\n\n\nImage entire PCs, individual drives or files\n\nThe most reliable way to protect yourself against data loss is if you make regular backups of your data and the operating system and store it on an external storage medium. When backing up your PC, O&amp;O DiskImage saves both personal files as well as drive information and individual settings. This not only protects irreplaceable files, such as family photos, vacation videos and office documents, but you also save yourself in the event of a crash the lengthy set up and reinstall of all the programs and the Windows operating system.\n\n\nRegular images are a must\n\nTo make sure your backups are always up to date, we recommend that you perform regular backups at short intervals. You can automate this with O&amp;O DiskImage, so that your data is backed up say once a week, for example, automatically and in the background.\n\n\nQuick and easy restoration\n\nIf you have backed up individual drives, you can easily restore them over the user interface of O&amp;O DiskImage under Windows. To restore an entire PC or the system partition you can run O&amp;O DiskImage without installation directly from the boot media.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nMinimum requirements of the respective system\nAt least 1 GB RAM recommended\n30 MB free hard disk space\n32/64-bit Support\nWindowsÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â« 8, 7, VistaÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â«, and XP (all Editions)\n\nHomepage: http://www.oo-software.com/en/products/oodiskimage\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.

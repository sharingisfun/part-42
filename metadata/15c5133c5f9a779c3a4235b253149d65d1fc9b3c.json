He is European by birth and an American citizen by choice, but are those two outlooks becoming increasingly hard to reconcile? There is tension over US surveillance that could affect Europeans and a division in NATO between what one US defence secretary calls those who pay - principally the Americans - and those who enjoy the benefits - the Europeans. As Ivo Daalder ends his term here, does he think it is time for this 64-year-old veteran security organisation to be pensioned off?\n\n\nInterviewed Guest: Ivo Daalder\nPresenter        : Shaun Ley\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02vl7w1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02vl7w1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c5133c5f9a779c3a4235b253149d65d1fc9b3c","amp;dn":"BBC+HARDtalk+-+06-13-2013+-+Ivo+Daalder+-+United+States+Permanen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15c5133c5f9a779c3a4235b253149d65d1fc9b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,197,19,60,95,154,119,156,58,66,53,178,83,20,157,101,209,252,155,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When the crew wakes up, McCoy finds Spock \r\nalive in sick bay but with his brain surgically removed. McCoy urges its quick restoration if he's to survive at all. Desperately Kirk follows an ion-trail \r\nto a system where he gambles on an icy planet populated by a all-male race of \r\nlarge cavemen who attack them. The landing party captures one, who tells Kirk \r\nthat he and crew are small like &quot;The Others&quot;, bringers of pain and delight, \r\nwhom they fear. McCoy beams down with Spock's (radio-controlled) body and they \r\nenter the underground city of &quot;The Others&quot; a simple-minded all-female race of enslavers. Kirk makes communicator contact with Spock, who knows not where he \r\nis but is aware of autonomic functions. As they finally find &quot;Kara&quot;, the \r\nfemale brain-thief, she overpowers them and, outfitting them with control \r\nbelts, brings them before a female panel to be judged. They soon realize that \r\nthere is no superior intellect among them capable of handling the technology \r\nto maintain the subterranean complex, and the 'controller' to which these women \r\nrefer is actually Spock's brain, which Kirk must somehow get back.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\nComplete name : 306 - Spocks Brain.mkv\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 2\r\nFile size : 511 MiB\r\nDuration : 50min 48sec\r\nOverall bit rate : 1405 Kbps\r\nEncoded date : UTC 2016-08-25T15:30:58Z\r\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.10.5\r\nWriting library : Lavf55.12.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 7 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nDuration : 50min 48sec\r\nBit rate : 1281 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1200 pixels\r\nHeight : 900 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\r\nCodec ID : A_AC3\r\nDuration : 50min 48sec\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 96.0 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a0bf873bc99dabb07a7675504d93d3e1b7d47d2","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+S03E06+%281968%29+-+BDRip+x264+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a0bf873bc99dabb07a7675504d93d3e1b7d47d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,11,248,115,188,153,218,187,7,167,103,85,4,217,61,62,27,125,71,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

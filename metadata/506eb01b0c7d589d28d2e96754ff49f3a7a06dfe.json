We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if this is true as is often the case with claims of this kind.  What we do know however is that MooreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role in shaping the sound of the Nat King Cole Trio, the first drummerless trio in jazz, was of paramount importance.  It is Oscar MooreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar we cherish on these 1937-1947 immortal sides the Cole Trio cut for various small labels.  Unfortunately, MooreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo career after leaving Cole never took off and he cut just a handful of records for the Verve and Tampa labels before retiting from the music business altogether and ending up working as a bricklayer in Los Angeles - a cryinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ shame.  This 1954 recording for the Tampa label with Carl Perkins amply demonstrates what an enormous talent and elegance in delivery Moore possessed. ~itsartolie\n\nPersonnel: \nOscar Moore: guitar \nCarl Perkins: piano \nJoe Comfort: bass \nMike Pacheco: bongos \nLee Young: drums\n\nRecorded 1954 in Hollywood, CA \n\nOscar Moore Quartet with Carl Perkins Tracks: \n01 Roulette \n02 The Nearness Of You \n03 Love For Sale \n04 Body And Soul \n05 Kenya \n06 Blues In B Flat \n07 Up Tempo \n08 Buddy Can You Spare A Dime \n09 ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Never Be Another You \n10 April In Paris \n11 Samson And Delilah Theme \n12 Moonlight In Vermont \n13 Kiss Me Again \n14 Dinner For One \n15 Walkin Home \n16 Warm Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506eb01b0c7d589d28d2e96754ff49f3a7a06dfe","amp;dn":"Oscar+Moore+Quartet+with+Carl+Perkins+%281954%29+%5BSmoothJazz%5D%5Bmp3+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506eb01b0c7d589d28d2e96754ff49f3a7a06dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,110,176,27,12,125,88,157,40,210,233,103,84,255,73,243,167,160,109,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

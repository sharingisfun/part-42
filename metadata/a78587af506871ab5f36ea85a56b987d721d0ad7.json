It contains all the elements of a marketable record and features some really great material. Perhaps the strongest piece on the album is &quot;Night Rider's Lament&quot;, a delightful song about a man's quest to live out his life as a cowboy in the west after giving up the comforts of his life back in the city. The song is bold, and Garth takes a risk with it by yodelling the final portion of the song in the stylings of the old country-western singers. The result is delightful, and a nod-of-the-hat to country music fans of yesteryear.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 10\nArtist: Garth Brooks\nAlbum: The Chase\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Country\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78587af506871ab5f36ea85a56b987d721d0ad7","amp;dn":"Garth+Brooks+-+The+Chase+%5BFLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78587af506871ab5f36ea85a56b987d721d0ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,133,135,175,80,104,113,171,95,54,234,133,165,107,152,125,114,29,10,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

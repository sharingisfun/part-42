BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert sees the progressive rock legends performing top-form versions of album tracks given the extra punch that BBC sessions seem to almost always promote. Though hard to track down, BBC Radio 1 Live is essential for Soft Machine, Robert Wyatt, and Hatfield the North fans. An essential session from a key group in the Canterbury progressive rock scene.\n - Skip Jansen, All Music Guide\n______________________________\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

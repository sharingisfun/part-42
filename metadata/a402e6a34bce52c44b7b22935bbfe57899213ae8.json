The eps have good quality.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s my previous Brainiac upload, with s01 + s02 + s03 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3455794/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3455794/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like Brainiac then you&amp;#039;ll like MythBusters. You can dl MythBusters here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3444602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3444602&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nObserve:\nI don&amp;#039;t want messeges concerning subs, there aren&amp;#039;t any in this torrent and I DON&amp;#039;T\nknow where to get them, so just learn english!\nDon&amp;#039;t msg me about &quot;i can&amp;#039;t play the files...&quot;, download VLC! (www.videolan.org)\nSeed atleast 1:1\nAnd don&amp;#039;t msg me about seeding if your dl averages around 20 KB/s\n\nif you have any other questions you are welcome to msg me @TPB :)\n\n\n\nSidenotes:\nHave in mind that not all you see on Brainiac is a 100% real.\nMany things are filmtricks. Like htf can vinegar mixed with baking soda result in such a violent reaction that it blows apart a microwave and bends the shell metal?? I say it&amp;#039;s fake - they put an explosive of some sort in there to make it look better on TV, which is cheap. Apart from the fake stuff and the totally rediculous/unscientific experiments this is a pretty entertaining show.\n\n\n\n-weezl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a402e6a34bce52c44b7b22935bbfe57899213ae8","amp;dn":"Brainiac+-+Science+Abuse+-+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a402e6a34bce52c44b7b22935bbfe57899213ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,2,230,163,75,206,82,196,75,123,34,147,91,191,229,120,153,33,58,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

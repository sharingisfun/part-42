It starts out with Bill (Fairbanks) and Toodles (Frank McHugh) being thrown out of the military for gallivanting with women when they should have been reporting back to a base. It is the wrong time to be discharged though; it is very hard to find work even as ex-pilots. Bill meets up with a beautiful stenographer named Patricia (Bette Davis) and the group teams up to find work and take care of each other. Slowly, they get involved in seedier and seedier jobs as their stomachs rumble and find themselves entangled in a dope ring.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ab507796f1ca511ccd54f29bd0354faa742f86","amp;dn":"Parachute+Jumper+%28Bette+Davis%2C+Douglas+Fairbanks%29+%5B1933%5D+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ab507796f1ca511ccd54f29bd0354faa742f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,171,80,119,150,241,202,81,28,205,84,242,155,208,53,79,170,116,47,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

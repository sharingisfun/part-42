They fight merciless duels over the front, day after day and the outcome is always the same: one pilot lives, the other burns. Then one day a German plane appears in the sky: an Albatross, a biplane with a beautiful Edelweiss on the upper-wing. The Pilot in the Edelweiss, as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instantly dubbed, sows death and destruction among the Stork Squadron, the elite flyers of the French Air Force. Why is the intrepid French ace, Henri Castillac -- recognized by everyone as a fine dogfighter -- so startled when the Edelweiss joins the fight? Does it have something to do with a nasty secret Henri shares with his brother Alphonse? And why was Alphonse, a first class pilot like his brother, thrown out of the Air Force?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9357625/Edelweiss_1-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9357625/Edelweiss_1-2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4daa6bf6f7e471dd4e107807e65c482190b66f3","amp;dn":"The+Pilot+in+the+Edelweiss+%233+-+Walburga+%282013%29+%28Josshart%29+%28Alic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4daa6bf6f7e471dd4e107807e65c482190b66f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,218,166,191,111,126,71,29,212,225,7,128,126,101,196,130,25,11,102,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

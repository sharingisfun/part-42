Over the course of her long career she is credited with introducing a variety of musical influences to the Italian pop scene. She was among the first to utilize reggae (with &quot;E la Luna Busso&quot;) and rap (on an early single, &quot;Movie&quot;). Bert? came from a musically inclined family, with a similarly successful sister, the vocalist Mia Martini. Working as a nude model up until that time, Bert? made her recording debut in 1974 with Streaking. It was her follow-up a year later, entitled Normale o Super, that made her famous with the single &quot;Sei Bellissima\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6104eabc753fee357d27351fd53a98fda60f07","amp;dn":"Loredana+Berte-Decisamente+Loredana+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6104eabc753fee357d27351fd53a98fda60f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,97,4,234,188,117,63,238,53,125,39,53,31,213,58,152,253,166,15,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

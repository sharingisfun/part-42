Each track on this album has been carefully crafted and attentively tweaked for a period of 4 years. Every little nuance has been considered, and all musical passages have been taken into account.\n\nThis album functions as a gateway to a galaxy far far away. Intended to be listened as a full trip, it connects each musical piece in a way of a planetary system. Still, each track is independent, with its own mindset for exploring sonic grounds and surroundings.\n\nAcoustic horizon of this record covers wide range of surreal and ordinary soundscapes, designed to tingle and tangle every layer of your mind. Playful progressions within beautiful compositions assure that melodic receptor of your auditory sense will be stimulated emotionally and challenged musically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1280a2300195cbb120c69133f7e5f30cbdd30281","amp;dn":"Kirna+-+In+Space+-+2012+%5Bpsychedelic+trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1280a2300195cbb120c69133f7e5f30cbdd30281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,128,162,48,1,149,203,177,32,198,145,51,247,229,243,12,189,211,2,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

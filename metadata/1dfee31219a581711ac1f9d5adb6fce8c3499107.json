Follow a cast of eccentric, complex charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€from elves with severe personality disorders to a caretaker of time and spaceÃ¢â‚¬â€as they brave worlds and leave lasting changes in their wake.\n\nWHERE MADNESS ROOSTS\nWITHIN RUIN\nEVERAUTUMN\n\nTitles are listed according to chronology, but Where Madness Roosts was written as a prequel and will contain some spoilers for Within Ruin. The books were, however, written as modular titles. Descriptions below.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHERE MADNESS ROOSTS - A Flameforged Story\n\nAlmi and Merill have lost everything. Now, they live only for vengeance.\n\nWhat should have been a routine diplomatic meeting has gone terribly awry. Their beloved king is found dead, murdered by one of the seven in attendance. Swearing revenge, Almi and Merill scoff at the idea of a whodunit.\n\nEveryone is guilty.\nEveryone will suffer.\nEveryone will die.\n\nJoin the sisters in a world warped by the heedless onset of madness. Follow as reality gives way to the weight of their despair, and they struggle to survive long enough to exact retribution.\n\n(Also includes &quot;The Scratching&quot;, a short story.)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWITHIN RUIN - The Flameforged Saga Book I\n\nDescarta yearned for adventure. If only she'd known what that truly meant.\n\nAdventure has a habit of not making meetings. A habit of relinquishing those unfortunate souls swept up in its thrillÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how wet behind the earsÃ¢â‚¬â€to misadventure. Misadventure is far less negligent. It'd rather stick around; share a tragedy or two.\n\nHistoric tales of legend tend to gloss over the nature of adventure in favor of glory and romance. As a queen imprisoned in her own castle, wed to a king she scarcely remembers or cares for, those embellished tales are all that keep Descarta going. She doesn't have the luxury or mercy of real world experience.\n\nSo when she finally embarks on the journey she's long pined for, Descarta is sorely ill-prepared. The very people she once despised or feared become her only means of survival in a world that wants to swallow her upÃ¢â‚¬â€a dark, pernicious world where anyone in their right mind would avoid adventure.\n\nSo it is that misadventure comes hard and heavy to the girl. But if she can remain strong in the harsh face of reality, Descarta will come to find that even love and friendship can blossom within ruin. She'll discover that her place in history is more far-reaching than anything contained in her tomes. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEVERAUTUMN - The Flameforged Saga Book II\n\nUndeath meant only that they could wait forever.\n\nEverautumn is a realm beyond common reality and common knowledge. Where retching volcanoes, unrelenting heat and ashen forests canopied with tufts of flame dominate scarcely hospitable terrain. A realm in the midst of conflict spanning millennia.\n\nAlmi and Merill have died. Their hearts no longer beat in the fashion they once did. Extirpated and deposited in the harsh, lava-sown world of Everautumn, they now survive as something seated between elf and undead. For six years they have endured, because they trust he will come.\n\nAccompanied by Descarta, the artificial weaveress; Elissa, the once-forgotten daughter; and Hafstagg, the paunchy warrior, Virgil has been sailing in search of a way to keep his promise to revive the elven twins. And he will stop at nothing to do so.\n\nEverautumn plans to challenge that. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThanks for reading!

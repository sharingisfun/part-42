Still present are the multi-culti layers of sound, the club-friendly beats, and the ethereal vocalists. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s missing is some of the hyper-kinetic energy and heavy drum presence that helped the first few Afro-Celt releases grab their audiences; in their place is a gentler, more soothing feel. Fiddler Eileen Ivers and flamenco guitarist Jesse Cook both make major contributions to the colorations of this new sound, while never quite upstaging the core bandmembers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:069ed34d8f196ca416609d6a81aaae40f256205f","amp;dn":"Afro+Celt+Sound+System+-+2003+-+Seed+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"069ed34d8f196ca416609d6a81aaae40f256205f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,158,211,77,143,25,108,164,22,96,157,106,129,170,174,64,242,86,32,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

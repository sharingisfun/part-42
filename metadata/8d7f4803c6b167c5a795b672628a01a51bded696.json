Site Designer runs inside Revit software and\nuses native families, components, and toposurfaces, so site designs\nbecome part of the overall model. You can model alternatives for mass\ngrading, building pads, streets, sidewalks, parking lots, and retaining\nwalls all within the Revit environment. More easily convert a sketched\nline into a street, sidewalk, curb and gutter, retaining wall or parking\nlot in the model. You can manipulate Site Designer components using\nediting tools to change their location, elevation, grade or geometry\nand Site Designer automatically updates and maintains the underlying\ntoposurface\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.autodesk.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.autodesk.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n1.

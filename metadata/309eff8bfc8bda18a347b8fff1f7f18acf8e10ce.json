We find out what footsteps, bait alarms and mobile phones sound like underwater ... and we also recorded the sounds that the carp make themselves!\nDave Lane can't resist a challenge and faced with a lake full of lilies and fallen branches he shows us how to find and avoid the snags and catch your fish. Dave goes float fishing and shares what is going on in his mind. It's a bit of a revelation.\nChampion angler, Bryan Jarrett, keeps trying to tell us his latest bait recipe but he can't stop catching fish! Luckily we managed to pin him down and extract the recipe that was so irresistible.\n\nIndependently financed, this dvd does not attempt to sell you bait and tackle on the side Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we only report the facts and so you only get the truth.\n\n\nNjoy!\n\n\nPLEASE SEED...

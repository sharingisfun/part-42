With little clue about how to earn a living, the pair start up a 'High Class Detective Agency', \n\nvaneyck, April, 2014\nI look forward to this with pleasure. I only know the pair as Charters and Caldicott, from both 'The Lady Vanishes', which you mentioned, and the excellent thriller 'Night Train to Munich', in which they play similar roles. Which reminds me: now that Demonoid's back I can likely get a decent copy of 'Night Train' and no longer have to depend on my aging VHS tape. Which is not the only benefit of the renaissance of Demonoid - You are back offering tons of films I've barely heard of and giving us good reasons why we should watch. I have gotten many hours of B&amp;W entertainment from you and your fabulous library. \n\nNeil-117, Melbourne, Australia, 25 April 2002\nThis spoof on the spy and detective genres is patchy but contains some flashes of humorous inspiration which still appeal more than half a century later. I had about half a dozen genuine belly laughs over the absurd antics of Otto the incompetent spy, Bright and Early the incompetent private detectives and a string of pompous, self-important British stereotypes. There's an awful lot of slapstick in between the occasional clever lines and you'll need to be a bit of a Marx Brothers or Buster Keaton fan to appreciate this minor British comedy to the full. But still a little better than much of what passed for comedy around this time.\n\nOh, and for all you folk in the USA, you'll only need to come to grips with about 60 seconds of actual cricket! \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 559mb\nDuration.... 01:17:24\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 696\nFrame Height.... 568\nData Rate....966kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 127kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f4f979632f6b586d1d534647acbbf38e21ce28c","amp;dn":"It%27s+Not+Cricket+1949+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f4f979632f6b586d1d534647acbbf38e21ce28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,79,151,150,50,246,181,134,209,213,52,100,122,203,191,56,226,28,226,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars or by running over pedestrians.\n\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, &quot;wasting&quot; (wrecking) all other race cars, or running over all pedestrians on the level before ...\n\nKnow what, fuck this description, if you don't know this game, you're not likely to want to play it anyways, since it's more than ten years old.\n\nThis is a package of the Windows version of Carmageddon and the Splat Pack, ready to go right out of the box. No more fiddling with DOSBox or anything, just unpack and play.\n\nAs this is not an iso, unfortunately the CD audio had to go, as had the cutscenes. Everything else is there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8a54a7b73c5a614603b41879a4bf155c9f8a74","amp;dn":"Carmageddon+%26+Splat+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8a54a7b73c5a614603b41879a4bf155c9f8a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,138,84,167,183,60,90,97,70,3,180,24,121,164,191,21,92,159,138,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I have been along time fan of Leon Russells like so many other that will likely read this review. This records contains previously released selections of his many records- on his self named label, but please do not let that fact detract the excellent music on this compact disc.\n\nI believe the records holds some of the best songs released over the last 15 years or so. &quot;Come For You&quot; is a song I play from &quot;Angel In Disguise&quot; also from the same record is the hot&quot; Honey And Eli&quot; the song certainly proves Leon still knows how to really drive a song like few others.\n\n&quot;Lost Inside The Blues&quot; here once again Leon is at the top of his game. Just love\n&quot;Sweet Magic Love&quot; a real country blues song that has that the Russell signature all over it. --  By rlasvegas\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.So hard to say goodbye                               [02:37]\n02.Come for you                                         [03:48]\n03.I love the way you love me                           [04:56]\n04.Honey and eli                                        [04:58]\n05.Blue eyes and A black heart                          [04:05]\n06.Sweet magic love                                     [03:01]\n07.Too hot to handle                                    [03:03]\n08.Lost inside the blues                                [04:27]\n09.I see the light                                      [03:39]\n10.Friendly fire                                        [04:09]\n________\n38:43 min\n58,10 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.

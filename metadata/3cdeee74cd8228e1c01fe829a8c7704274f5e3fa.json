Somehow, you must get the power they possess. The only way to obtain that is through cyber implants. You've got to survive? and you've got to leave this godforsaken place ... OR DIE! \n\nMetalheart: Replicants Rampage is a cyberpunk role-playing game. Lead your team to success using smart tactics; explore a huge isometric world, experience unique cybernetic body implants and tactical, turn-based combat. The player controls a team of up to 6 members (choose from replicants, cyborgs, mutants and nomads.) Allying with different groups changes the flow of the game: being hostile to nomads opens the way to getting friendly cyborgs or mutants to provide new quests. A lot also depends on the composition of the team: a pure cyborg team requires a different strategy than mutants or nomads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cdeee74cd8228e1c01fe829a8c7704274f5e3fa","amp;dn":"Metal+Heart+-+Replicants+Rampage+%5B2CDs%5D%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cdeee74cd8228e1c01fe829a8c7704274f5e3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,222,238,116,205,130,40,225,192,31,232,41,168,199,112,66,116,245,227,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

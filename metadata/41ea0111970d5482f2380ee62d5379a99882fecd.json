This year's? To see a real-live naked girl for the first time Ã¢â‚¬â€ quite a challenge, given that none of the guys has the nerve to even ask a girl out on a date. But catching a girl in the buff starts to look easy compared to Matt's other summertime aspiration: to swim the 100-yard butterfly (the hardest stroke known to God or man) as a way to impress Kelly West, the sizzling new star of the swim team. In the spirit of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blockbuster comedies, screenwriter-turned-YA-novelist Don Calame unleashes a true ode to the adolescent male: characters who are side-splittingly funny, sometimes crude, yet always full of heart. \n\nBeat the Band (Swim the Fly #2)\n\nIn this hilarious sequel to Swim the Fly, told from CoopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the beginning of the school year, and the tenth-grade health class must work in pairs on semester-long projects. Matt and Sean get partnered up (the jerks), but Coop is matched with the infamous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hot DogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Helen for a presentation on safe sex. EverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laughing, except for Coop, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convinced that the only way to escape this social death sentence is to win Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Battle of the BandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with their group, Arnold MurphyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bologna Dare. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one problem: none of the guys actually plays an instrument. Will Coop regain his Ã¢â‚¬Å“coolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late? Or will the forced one-on-one time with Helen teach him a lesson about social status he never saw coming? With ribald humor and a few sweet notes, screenwriter-turned-novelist Don Calame once again hits all the right chords.\n\nCall the Shots (Swim the Fly #3)\n\nCoop is cooking up another sure-misfire scheme (big surprise), and this time the comedy plays out from SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the new master plan? Making a cheapo horror movie guaranteed to make Coop, Sean, and Matt filthy rich! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a terrible idea, and Sean knows it. But he actually is desperate for cash Ã¢â‚¬â€ and for a way to wipe that big fat L off his girlfriend-less forehead. But when he agrees to write a script about the attack of zombie-vampire humanzees, he has no idea just how powerful a chick magnet this movie will be. Suddenly Sean is juggling not one but three interested ladies. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his accidental-girlfriend-turned-psychotic-stalker, Evelyn. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the wicked hot actress from drama class, Leyna, who seems willing to do anything to land the starring role. And even his twin sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gothed-out best friend, Nessa, is looking at Sean in a whole new way. Will any of them wind up as SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true leading lady? Will Sean stop being a doormat and finally start calling the shots?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ea0111970d5482f2380ee62d5379a99882fecd","amp;dn":"Swim+the+fly+%28SERIES%29+by+Don+Calame+%5BePub%5D+-+Xetron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ea0111970d5482f2380ee62d5379a99882fecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,234,1,17,151,13,84,130,242,56,14,230,45,83,121,169,152,130,254,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

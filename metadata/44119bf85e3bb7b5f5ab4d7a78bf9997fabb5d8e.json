Raised at the feet of George Clinton and George Lucas on a diet of Sci-Fi, Funk and Hip-Hop in a distant galaxy comes K+Lab with his debut album 'Space Dirt'. Starburst synths, anti-matter beats and battle-star bass all collide in a musical metaverse of galactic dimensions. Armed with his lazer keytar, K+lab and his crew of misfits go on a warp speed mission to explore the outer reaches of the glitch-hop universe. The code they live by &quot;Free your ass and your soul will follow&quot;. Interconnecting like an Voltron of awesomeness, they searched to find and bring us the deepest and darkest funk matter, known as 'Space Dirt'. Along the way encountering Black-holes, Lazer cats, Bangvaders, Lord Steezington, Captain Crack Juice and the collapse of gravity. People of earth the mothership has landed with a cargo hold full of 'Space Dirt' time to free your ass so your soul will follow! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44119bf85e3bb7b5f5ab4d7a78bf9997fabb5d8e","amp;dn":"K%2BLab+-+Space+Dirt+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44119bf85e3bb7b5f5ab4d7a78bf9997fabb5d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,17,155,248,94,59,183,181,245,171,77,122,120,191,153,151,250,187,93,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

My name is Parker Shawn Gohs (A.k.a Shawn Parker). I am 19 years old and I have been\na truth seeker since I was 13. My main focus has been on health, philosophy, and politics, but I have\nstudied many other subjects over the years as well.\n\nI have placed all of my knowledge into a series of three books, in addition to an untitled\ncollection of photo-copied notes. I have uploaded everything to the internet so people can download all\nof my works for free.\n\nI have declared abandonment (legal term meaning to release without any intention of reclaiming) and given up all copyrights for all of my writings so anybody and everybody has a right to do whatever they want with them, regardless of if they do it for profit or non-profit\npurposes (treat my books and writings as your own). The only thing I am asking is for people to please download my works from any of the links\nbelow and upload them to other websites so that they will never be successfully censored or restricted\nby any government or organization. The titles of my 3 books are: 1) Change Up the System; 2)\nCollections: Volume 1; and, 3) The Truth Revolution &amp; Conspiracy in Theory. All of my writings\n(including notes) can be found in a folder called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Shawn Parker Collection.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThese books contain everything I have learned over the last 5 years. I am offering them all for\nfree because I sincerely believe the information within these books to be infinitely more valuable than\nany amount of money. Since becoming a truth seeker, I have been waiting for someone to write a book\nof all the problems facing humanity and how to solve them. After realizing that nobody else would\nwrite the book I was looking for, I decided to write it myself. People can now learn in 5 days what took\nme 5 years to learn. Please spread these books because I know they have the power to spread and\naccelerate a global, peaceful, revolution.\n\nAs for myself, I have basically given away all of my belongings except for what I can fit in a\nsingle backpack and $2,500 worth of illusionary money which I have placed in Chase Bank, so I can\nlive life as a homeless drifter until I find enlightenment. I may die at 19, or I may live a bit longer, but I\nhonestly believe that my books are more valuable than my body. Please help keep my books alive; this\nis the only thing I ask of you.\n\nI have faith that I am doing the right thing. Faith is more than just thoughts or words. Faith is\nbelieving in something enough to take action.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Blessed are the peace makersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDownload Links:\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4627ce108ee9fa54667215bac56a7d9a505b0334","amp;dn":"The+Shawn+Parker+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4627ce108ee9fa54667215bac56a7d9a505b0334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,39,206,16,142,233,250,84,102,114,21,186,197,106,125,154,80,91,3,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I&amp;#039;m quite sure it hasn&amp;#039;t changed much between now and then (with maybe the exception of Windows Vista stuff being added) so it should suit the needs of anyone who codes for Windows 9X/ME/2K/NT/XP/Server.  It integrates with Visual Studio.\n\nIt took me forever to find this so keep this torrent going!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ae81386f47699ea489c690625826204f5abbc4","amp;dn":"MSDN+Library+September+2006+-+3+CDs+%28bin%2Fcue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ae81386f47699ea489c690625826204f5abbc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,174,129,56,111,71,105,158,164,137,198,144,98,88,38,32,79,90,187,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Faced with financial troubles she drifts into prostitution. Nana believes she makes this choice of her own free will, but the film emphasises the social structure that forces the poor into such situations, and builds to a tragic conclusion. Rather than glamorizing prostitution (as in, for example, Pretty Woman), Godard analyses it from a sociological perspective. In fact, one of the film&amp;#039;s original sources is a study of contemporary prostitution, OÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ en est la prostitution by Marcel Sacotte, an examining magistrate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858909e04e4dbadeba08c0daa254bde10f008914","amp;dn":"Godard+-+It%5C%27s+My+Life+%28Vivre+sa+vie%3A+Film+en+douze+tablea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858909e04e4dbadeba08c0daa254bde10f008914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,137,9,224,78,77,186,222,186,8,192,218,162,84,189,225,15,0,137,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Andersson et al. (Cambridge University Press, 2011).pdf\n\nISBN 9781107018952\n\nComputational fluid dynamics, CFD, has become an indispensable tool for many engineers. This book gives an introduction to CFD simulations of turbulence, mixing, reaction, combustion and multiphase flows. The emphasis on understanding the physics of these flows helps the engineer to select appropriate models to obtain reliable simulations. Besides presenting the equations involved, the basics and limitations of the models are explained and discussed. The book combined with tutorials, project and power-point lecture notes (all available for download) forms a complete course. The reader is given hands-on experience of drawing, meshing and simulation. The tutorials cover flow and reactions inside a porous catalyst, combustion in turbulent non-premixed flow, and multiphase simulation of evaporation spray respectively. The project deals with design of an industrial-scale selective catalytic reduction process and allows the reader to explore various design improvements and apply best practice guidelines in the CFD simulations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43d3daac1987384ffdb68e23a9b8801ef9f332d","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+for+Engineers+-+B.+Andersson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43d3daac1987384ffdb68e23a9b8801ef9f332d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,61,61,170,193,152,115,132,255,219,104,226,58,155,136,1,239,159,51,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Statring with Two People. They were a Brit band of the mid-80s, who released a full album [Heaven] and a handful of singles. But the music they made was just fantastic. so here you are. This is The Shirt, Rescue Me, Mouth of An Angel, Heaven, Let&amp;#039;s Raise Murder and Back Into The Room Of Blue are the standout tunes. After the video of Rescue Me was posted on Youtube, their music has attracted many new listeners and brought back memories for those who knew them. This for sure it&amp;#039;s an amazing piece of new romantic music.\n\nTwo People - The Collection\n\n01 Mouth Of An Angel (Extended Mix)\n02 Heaven\n03 Rescue Me\n04 Let&amp;#039;s Raise Murder\n05 This Is The Shirt\n06 Dig It\n07 Back Into The Room Of Blue\n08 Broken Arms\n09 Run To Him\n10 It&amp;#039;s Obvious\n11 People In Love\n11 This Is The Day (Part 1)\n12 Sister Sister\n13 This Is The Day (Part 2)\n14 Wonderful Thing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30480e5afac49b9fdcdccf8bb6a3b1ca0d9a2316","amp;dn":"Lost+80s+LPs+Two+People+-+The+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30480e5afac49b9fdcdccf8bb6a3b1ca0d9a2316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,72,14,90,250,196,155,159,220,220,207,139,182,163,177,202,13,154,35,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

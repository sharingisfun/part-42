For Alex Haley, one side was roots, the towering chronicle tracing severn generations of his mother&amp;#039;s family. The othe side comes to the screen in Alex Haley&amp;#039;s Queen, the remarkable history of a paternal side of the author&amp;#039;s family. David L. Wolper (Roots, The Thorn Birds) is the executive producer of this acclaimed adaption of the story Haley was working on when he died. Halle Berry plays Queen, daughter of a slave (Jasmine Guy) and a plantation owner (Tim Daly). During the turbulent decades of the antebellum South, the Civil war, Reconstruction and beyond, she searches for a home in the two cultures of her heritage - and at times is shunned by both. Rejection and hate are no match for her unconquerable will, however. Ann-Margret, Danny Glover, and Ossie Davis are among the many stars of this poingnant, uplifting final chapter of the Haley legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc433ba195bc1626e9bf5d1e4346a0e4987f05a","amp;dn":"Alex+Haleys+-+Queen+-+Part+I+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc433ba195bc1626e9bf5d1e4346a0e4987f05a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,196,51,186,25,91,193,98,110,155,245,209,228,52,106,14,73,135,240,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Their melodic, spell-binding music cuts a dash between traditional British Folk and modern Indie. Equally at home playing in a darkened, candle-lit cellar as they are in a sunny (or more often rainy) festival field, their music takes the audience from catchy, foot stomping folk-rock to mellow, mysterious lullabies and back.\n\nIn the past year they have played at an array of festivals across the UK and been invited back to all of them! Played a number of live radio sessions including the BBC, recorded their debut album, sold out venues such as the world famous Stables and recorded in a dungeon!\n\nEach listener seems to compare them to a different artist. This year so far they have had; Low, Tunng, Fairport Convention, Belle &amp; Sebastian, The Grateful Dead, Arcade Fire, Pentangle and Bonnie Prince Billy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dab64280365ac79a822117f1d79ea1509530489","amp;dn":"The+Galleons+-+The+Galleons+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dab64280365ac79a822117f1d79ea1509530489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,171,100,40,3,101,172,121,168,34,17,127,29,121,234,21,9,83,4,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

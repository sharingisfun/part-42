The B-36 was the largest mass-produced piston engined aircraft ever made and the biggest wingspan combat aircraft ever built, although there have been larger military transports. The B-36 was the first bomber capable of delivering thermonuclear weapons from within a fully-enclosed bomb-bay. With a range of over 6,000 miles (9,700 km) and a maximum payload of at least 72,000 lb (33,000 kg), the B-36 was the first operational bomber with an intercontinental range, setting the standard for subsequent USAF long range bombers, such as the B-52 Stratofortress, B-1 Lancer, and B-2 Spirit.\n\nGreat Planes looks into the stories behind the most influential, innovative and intriguing machines that ever took flight. This episode features the Convair P-36 Peacemaker. The huge aircraft boasted six engines and made its mighty presence felt during the Cold War, when the threat of a nuclear war loomed large. The Peacemaker was considered the Cold War's most effective nuclear deterrent. The world's first true intercontinental bomber, the mammoth B36 bomber was capable of flying at 40,000 feet, over 400 mph, and carrying a payload up to 72,000 lbs and was the big stick of the West for much of the Cold War.\n\nDirector : Barry Cawthorn \nProducer : Phil Osborn\n\nTasmanian Film Corporation Pty.Ltd. and Discovery Networks (1989)\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n----------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2154 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 592x448\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.321:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 47:46.400\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 854,763,520 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46dd8f08623e554eb4ef1bb30cbf7112469aafd","amp;dn":"Discovery.Wings.Great.Planes.Convair.B-36.Peacemaker.XviD.AC3.MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46dd8f08623e554eb4ef1bb30cbf7112469aafd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,109,216,240,134,35,229,84,235,78,241,187,48,203,247,17,36,105,170,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

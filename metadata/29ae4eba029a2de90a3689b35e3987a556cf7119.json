This is the second release from the stable/9 branch, which improves on the stability of FreeBSD 9.1 and introduces some new features. Some of the highlights:\n\n    The ZFS filesystem now supports TRIM when used on solid state drives.\n\n    The virtio(4) drivers have been added to the GENERIC kernel configuration for amd64 and i386 architectures.\n\n    The ZFS filesystem now supports lz4 compression.\n\n    OpenSSL has been updated to version 0.9.8y.\n\n    DTrace hooks have been enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel.\n\n    DTrace has been updated to version 1.9.0.\n\n    Sendmail has been updated to version 8.14.7.\n\n    OpenSSH has been updated to version 6.2p2.\n\n    Import unmapped I/O support from head/.\n\nFor a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the online release notes and errata list, available at:\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/9.2R/relnotes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/9.2R/relnotes.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities, please see:\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAvailability\n\nFreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, powerpc64, and sparc64 architectures.\n\nFreeBSD 9.2 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory stick. The required files can be downloaded via FTP as described in the section below. While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures, they will all generally contain the more common ones such as amd64 and i386.\n\nMD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO and memory stick images are included at the bottom of this message.\n\nThe purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows:\n\nmemstick\n\n    This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also supports booting into a &quot;livefs&quot; based rescue mode. There are no pre-built packages.\n\n    As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should work:\n\n    # dd if=FreeBSD-9.2-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs=10240 conv=sync\n\n    Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29ae4eba029a2de90a3689b35e3987a556cf7119","amp;dn":"FreeBSD+9.2-RELEASE+AMD64+Memstick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29ae4eba029a2de90a3689b35e3987a556cf7119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,174,78,186,2,154,45,233,10,54,137,179,94,57,135,165,86,207,113,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This is because software deals with ideas rather than with self-evident physical artefacts. However, this development step is hardly ever done, as ontologies rely on well-defined and semantically powerful AI concepts such as description logics or rule-based systems, and most software engineers are largely unfamiliar with these.\n\nGaÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡evic and his co-authors try to fill this gap by covering the subject of MDA application for ontology development on the Semantic Web. Part I of their book describes existing technologies, tools, and standards like XML, RDF, OWL, MDA, and UML. Part II presents the first detailed description of OMGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new ODM (Ontology Definition Metamodel) initiative, a specification which is expected to be in the form of an OMG language like UML. Finally, Part III is dedicated to applications and practical aspects of developing ontologies using MDA-based languages. The book is supported by a website showing many ontologies, UML and other MDA-based models, and the transformations between them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f0bc68956ace2b4f1a3f37ffcffcc42c97db83","amp;dn":"Model+Driven+Engineering+and+Ontology+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f0bc68956ace2b4f1a3f37ffcffcc42c97db83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,240,188,104,149,106,206,43,79,26,63,55,255,207,252,196,44,151,219,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was released in 2000.\n\nThe album&amp;#039;s title comes from the slogan of a Toronto soft rock station, EZRock. Its use is meant to be ironic; the first line of the title track is &quot;Everything is bleak, it&amp;#039;s the middle of the night/you&amp;#039;re all alone and the dummies might be right.&quot; The music video for &quot;Music at Work&quot; was filmed in the lobby of Commerce Court North, part of the headquarters of the Canadian bank CIBC.\n\nMuch like their previous album, Phantom Power, it had decent sales in Canada.\n\nAfter the album was released, singer Gordon Downie released a solo album of music and poetry called Coke Machine Glow.\n\nAll songs were written by The Tragically Hip\n\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n&quot;My Music at Work&quot; \n&quot;The Completists&quot; \n&quot;Lake Fever&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:363377e684fb39125f372f66e08e92673f7b1c25","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+2000+-+Music+%40+Work","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"363377e684fb39125f372f66e08e92673f7b1c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,51,119,230,132,251,57,18,95,55,47,102,224,142,146,103,63,123,28,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

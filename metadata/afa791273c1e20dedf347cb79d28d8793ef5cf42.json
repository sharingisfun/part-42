Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively in character as lead vocalist &quot;Joliet&quot; Jake Blues and harpist/vocalist Elwood Blues, fronted the band, which was composed of well-known and respected musicians. The band made its debut as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe band began to take on a life beyond the confines of the television screen, releasing an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, in 1978, and then having a Hollywood film, The Blues Brothers, created around its characters in 1980.\n\nAfter the death of Belushi in 1982, the Blues Brothers have continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members. The band reformed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for a sequel to the film, Blues Brothers 2000. They make regular appearances at musical festivals worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlues brothers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2000 1998\n\n\n\nBlues Brothers 2000: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the 1998 film, Blues Brothers 2000, the sequel to the 1980 film, The Blues Brothers.

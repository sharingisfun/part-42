They made a list of necessities, then set about filling them: gritted teeth; outsized torsos; extreme shirtlessness; breasts the size of Goodyear blimps; physically-impossible poses; giant guns that fired smaller guns that fired chainsaws, and; enough cross-hatching to to cause Image Comics to file a plagarism suit. Add it together and you got a blood-spattering coughing-fit from the soon-to-die epic imprint.\n\nYour mileage may vary.\n\nStill, there was some nice talent involved, including Howard Chaykin (Midnight Men), Mike Baron (Spyke and Feud), Mike Vosburg (Offcastes), Peter David &amp; George Perez (Sachs and Violens), Ron Lim (Dragon Lines) and even the great Joe Kubert doing writing and art chores on a four-issue run of Tor.\n\nSo, oil your mullet, pull up your pastel bean-bag and crank up the grunge music. It's the 90's, bitches!\n\nAll hail the creative teams and original scanners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:313330139dc45b249601ad8981fd9a868ee98238","amp;dn":"Heavy+Hitters+line+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"313330139dc45b249601ad8981fd9a868ee98238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,51,48,19,157,196,91,36,150,1,173,137,129,253,154,134,142,233,130,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

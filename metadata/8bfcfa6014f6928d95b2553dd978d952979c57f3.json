Still the band, led by guitarists Hayim Romano and Michael Gabrielov, did rock and even boasted an ex-Tornado (of Ã¢â‚¬Å“TelstarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ fame) Rob Huxley, in their ranks, who wrote or co-wrote most of their output presented on this compilation in its entirety. A live cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A WomanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aside, the ensemble, granted the title of the Israeli Beatles, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aspire to the beat glory though, having opted rather for a variety of styles from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sunshine ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ exquisite psychedelia and THE PLATTERS-like romanticism of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Talk To MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the Stax-shaped Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coming HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nEclectic and confusing indeed, if one takes it too seriously, which would be a mistake, as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Straight PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a stab at THE DOORS, suggests. Still, seriousness has to be involved here, with impressive rendition of BachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Double ConcertoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chorale For The Young LoversÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recorded with The Israeli Philarmonic Orchestra at the same time when DEEP PURPLE did the similar thing. The two bands, incidentally, toured together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when THE CHURCHILLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S evolved into JERICHO JONES, whose highly sought-after album is included in this package as well. The progress towards heaviness started already on their 1969Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with sharp Ã¢â‚¬Å“ComicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but there's also been a strong folk influence in Middle Eastern-colored &quot;Debka&quot; and &quot;Subsequent Finale&quot;, to not accuse them of blindly following the trends, especially after entering the '70s with a not too inventive version of ZEPPELIN's &quot;Living Loving&quot;. This - and said eclecticism - aside, the band were great, their songs easily on par with those that made it to the top, while THE CHURCHILL's didn't. Still massively revered, now they must be up there too.[/quote]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bfcfa6014f6928d95b2553dd978d952979c57f3","amp;dn":"Churchill%27s+%26amp%3B+Junkies+Monkeys+Donkeys+%281968-1971%29+%5Bflac%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bfcfa6014f6928d95b2553dd978d952979c57f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,252,250,96,20,246,146,141,149,178,85,61,217,120,217,82,151,156,87,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

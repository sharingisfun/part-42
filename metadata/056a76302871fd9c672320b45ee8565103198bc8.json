BEN AND KATE, a new single-camera young ensemble comedy, follows these odd-couple siblings as they push each other out of their comfort zones and into real life. KATE FOX (Dakota Johnson, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Social NetworkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) followed the rules all her lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until she got pregnant in college and dropped out just shy of graduation. After the birth of her daughter, MADDIE (Maggie Jones, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Bought a Zoo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“FootlooseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Kate put her twenties on hold. Now working as a bar manager to make ends meet and maximize her time with five-year-old Maddie, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uber-prepared for every possible catastrophe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ except for the arrival of her older brother, BEN FOX (Nat Faxon, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad TeacherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Ben likes trouble a lot more than his sister does. His infectious energy makes you want to follow him into any number of bad ideas. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll totally screw up your life, but somehow, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll feel good about it. Where Kate is all about planning and preparing, Ben is big on spontaneity and out-of-the-box ideas. But donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let the Velcro wallet fool you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably be a millionaire someday. When Ben comes to crash on KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s couch for a few days, he finds a sad state of affairs. KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surviving, but not living. Ben realizes that for the first time in their lives, Kate needs his help and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to bring some much-needed chaos into her overly stable world. He starts by offering to help look after Maddie so Kate can get back to experiencing her mid-twenties and making mistakes, since the one real Ã¢â‚¬Å“mistakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to her. Always there to help with BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crazy schemes is his partner-in-crime, TOMMY (newcomer Echo Kellum), who worships Ben like a hero and nurses a serious crush on Kate. KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s British best friend, BJ (Lucy Punch, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad TeacherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), is a cocktail waitress at the bar that Kate manages and an all-around hot mess who would do anything for Kate, even if her advice is often questionable and occasionally illegal. From writer/executive producer Dana Fox (New Girl, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Happens in VegasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and executive producer/director Jake Kasdan (New Girl, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad TeacherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), BEN AND KATE is a heartwarming story of deeply mismatched siblings: a sister who needs to go for her dreams and a brother who needs to get his head out of the clouds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056a76302871fd9c672320b45ee8565103198bc8","amp;dn":"Ben.and.Kate.S01E13.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056a76302871fd9c672320b45ee8565103198bc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,106,118,48,40,113,253,156,103,35,32,180,94,232,86,81,3,25,139,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Violence. Madness. Bedlam. A holiday paradise gone mad. A tropical island turns into total chaos after a mysterious zombie outbreak. Cut off from the rest of the world, the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only chance to survive is to fight to the death and find a way to escape from the island.\n\nDead Island combines first-person action with a heavy focus on melee combat, character development and customization of a vast array of weapons. All of these gameplay features are presented in a dark story inspired by classic zombie movies with a gritty and engrossing campaign that can be played with up to four players in co-op mode.\n\nSet in an open world tropical island, hordes of different festering zombies await players around every corner while they embark on a variety of thrilling missions through the holiday resort. With firearms and ammunition being scarce the player must rely on utilizing found items as weapons for self-defense and fight off zombie hordes in intense melee combat. A diverse range of items can be collected and will later serve to transform the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ordinary makeshift weapons into serious instruments of destruction.\n\nIn addition to satisfying even the most bloodthirsty action fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasy, Dead Island also features role-playing elements which allow the player to develop one of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique character classes according to their preferences, all the while learning new skills and fresh tactics during their journey through the perilous environments of the island.

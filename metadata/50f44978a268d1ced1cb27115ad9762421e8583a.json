However the dupe frame pattern is somewhat\nrandom. Mostly 1/5, sometimes 2/5, sometimes 3/5, sometimes 1/3. \nIn other words, it doesn't only look like it was shot with a cellphone half the time, \nit's also pretty jerky with a lot of missing frames (in the actual source too not only \nin the encode).\n\nFor masochists who like garbage like Anthrax. \n\nSHiTTYMCSHiTTY are proud to present the most shitty releases ever to hit the DVD\nscene! This was given over to us as it isn't standup but someone said it was!\n\nThat person has now been tagged as a SHiTTYMCSHiTTYHEAD. You know who you are..\nOne clue, it isn't wile e coyote.\n\n\n\n     (   )\n  (   ) (\n   ) _   )\n    ( _\n  _(_ )__\n (_______))\n\nIf that ASCII art doesn't work it's because we're shitty","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f44978a268d1ced1cb27115ad9762421e8583a","amp;dn":"Scott.Ian.Live.2014.Swearing.Words.In.Glasgow.DVDRip.x264-SHiTTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f44978a268d1ced1cb27115ad9762421e8583a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,244,73,120,162,104,209,206,209,203,39,17,90,217,118,36,33,232,88,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

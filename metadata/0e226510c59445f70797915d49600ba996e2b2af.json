On The Contemplative Journey, Father Thomas Keating teaches his uplifting system of Centering Prayer, a revival of the contemplations practiced in the cloisters and monasteries of Europe since medieval times. The practice of Centering Prayer, Father Keating explains, cultivates the ability to directly connect with God's infinite love. Sometimes called &quot;divine therapy,&quot; this authentically Christian meditation system has helped thousands clear away past traumas and open to the energy of the divine.\n\nIncludes all MP3s, course PDF, and cover\n\nThis is the second volume, and presumes the listener has studied volume 1 before attempting this.\n\nVolume 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11431301/Thomas_Keating_-_The_Contemplative_Journey_Volume_1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e226510c59445f70797915d49600ba996e2b2af","amp;dn":"Thomas+Keating+-+The+Contemplative+Journey+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e226510c59445f70797915d49600ba996e2b2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,34,101,16,197,148,69,247,7,151,145,93,73,96,11,169,150,226,178,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Younger artists were pointing Irish music in exciting new directions, combining Celtic elements with everything from rock to hip-hop. And plenty of traditional Irish/Celtic artists were still around, including Tommy Makem. When Rolling Home came out in 1989, the veteran singer was 56 Ã¢â‚¬â€ and at that point, he brought a lot of maturity and wisdom to his work. In traditional Irish folk singing, being an effective storyteller is everything. That was never a problem for Makem, who brings a lot of charm and charisma to original songs like &quot;Brendan&quot; (an ode to the 6th century Irish saint), &quot;Long Winter Nights,&quot; and the title track, as well as traditional gems that Irish singers have been performing for generations. Anyone who is seriously into Irish/Celtic music will be quite familiar with &quot;Courting in the Kitchen&quot; and &quot;The Boys of Mullaghbawn,&quot; which goes back to the 18th century and was an Irish standard long before the advent of recording technology. Another highlight of this CD is &quot;The Town I Love So Well,&quot; Phil Coulter's poignant account of the turmoil that had ravaged his native Derry. If Makem sometimes reminds you of American country, folk, and western singers, it is no coincidence Ã¢â‚¬â€ the folk traditions of Ireland, Scotland, and England had a major impact on the country, folk and cowboy/western music that developed in the United States. Rolling Home isn't Makem's best or most essential release, but it's a solid, pleasing effort that the Irishman can easily be proud of.\n\nV0 mp3 - Ripped to FLAC with EAC, transcoded to mp3 with dBpoweramp.\n\nBrendan\nCourting in the Kitchen\nLong Winter Nights\nRolling Home\nThe Battle of Benburb\nThe Boys of Mullaghbawn\nThe Songs the Water Sings\nThe Town I Love So Well\nThose Factory Girls\nWaltzing With Bears\nWhalers Tale\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27b066059131ec5f4503020528642f24477b465e","amp;dn":"Tommy+Makem+-+Rolling+Home+%28Irish+Folk+Songs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27b066059131ec5f4503020528642f24477b465e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,176,102,5,145,49,236,95,69,3,2,5,40,100,47,36,71,123,70,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Now summer stretches before her with nowhere to go but home, at least until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to go back to medical school.\n\nDetermined to prove she might be down but definitely not out, she chucks all her old plans in favor of having a good timeÃ¢â‚¬â€starting with giving herself a pair of wings. Tattooed wings, that is, in the form of a phoenix on her back.\n\nWhen everyone else at Dermamania chickens out at the prospect of putting the gorgeous, perfect skin of the bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big sister under the needle, Ian Rhodes finds himself stepping up. Then unexpectedly connecting with her through tears that have nothing to do with the pain of getting inked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ee41050cba10aba4b541c73db5a2cc76c9a587","amp;dn":"Cherrie+Lynn+-Take+Me+On+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ee41050cba10aba4b541c73db5a2cc76c9a587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,238,65,5,12,186,16,171,164,181,65,199,61,181,162,204,118,201,165,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

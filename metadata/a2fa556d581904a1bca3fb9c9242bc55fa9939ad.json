Scrinis argues this ideology has narrowed and in some cases distorted our appreciation of food quality, such that even highly processed foods may be perceived as healthful depending on their content of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; nutrients. Investigating the butter versus margarine debate, the battle between low-fat, low-carb, and other weight-loss diets, and the food industry's strategic promotion of nutritionally enhanced foods, Scrinis reveals the scientific, social, and economic factors driving our modern fascination with nutrition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fa556d581904a1bca3fb9c9242bc55fa9939ad","amp;dn":"Nutritionism%3A+The+Science+and+Politics+of+Dietary+Advice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fa556d581904a1bca3fb9c9242bc55fa9939ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,250,85,109,88,25,4,161,188,163,251,156,146,66,188,85,250,153,57,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This is in no small part due to the fact that the Coen brothers&amp;#039; fantastic dialogue and music selection are the heart and soul of the movie.\n\nSo I converted my DVD copy to AVI using the method described on this website...\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.matthawkins.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.matthawkins.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd an excellent method it is, too!  Unfortunately Matt Hawkins&amp;#039; website is no more, so I will have to put his advice somewhere - perhaps in wikipedia.\n\nThen I used the equally excellent piece of software called WavePad (http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/masters.html) to edit the AVI of the film and just save the audio track as an MP3 file.  You can also load up the AC3 file created by the AGK program when it rips the DVD VOB files to AVI, and convert the AC3 to MP3.\n\nI then went through the audio track and edited each &amp;#039;scene&amp;#039; into its own MP3 track and saved these as I went through the film.  The titles I gave the tracks are partially arbitrary - I&amp;#039;m sure other Achievers (see: http://www.amazon.com/Im-Lebowski-Youre-Life-What/dp/1596912464 and http://lebowskifest.com/) would give the tracks the names their preferred nomenclature.  But then, you can always rename your own copies of the tracks to whatever you want.\n\nThe tracks are standard MP3 with tags and are 128 kbps.  I edited the files with MusicMatch version 9, to include images from the film (captured as snapshots using VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).\n\nSo now you too can listen to the film on your MP3 player during those times when it&amp;#039;s not safe (you don&amp;#039;t want to get caught by the man and have to call in Bill Kunstler) or appropriate to watch it on your TV, PC or what-have-you.\n\nAnd remember: the Dude abides.\n\nPS. Hey bums, can I be an Achiever, now?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nList of tracks...\n\n01 Tumbleweeds - He called himself the Dude.mp3\n02 Where&amp;#039;s the money Lebowski.mp3\n03 The Man in Me - I&amp;#039;m throwing rocks tonight.mp3\n04 This was a valued rug.mp3\n05 This is the study.mp3\n06 OK, so you&amp;#039;re a Lebowski, I&amp;#039;m a Lebowski.mp3\n07 How was your meeting Mr Lebowski.mp3\n08 Slammin&amp;#039; &amp;#039;em tonight - you guys are dead in the water.mp3\n09 These guys are like me, they&amp;#039;re pacifists.mp3\n10 Dude, this is Smoky - Performing my dance quintet.mp3\n11 We&amp;#039;ve had some terrible news.mp3\n12 Hotel California - That creep can roll, man.mp3\n13 The Man in Me - Kafka Break No.1.mp3\n14 Her life is in your hands Dude.mp3\n15 They&amp;#039;re gonna kill that poor woman, man.mp3\n16 Green with some ah brown ah rust coloration.mp3\n17 Does the female form make you uncomfortable Mr Lebowski.mp3\n18 I gotta rash - I will not abide another toe.mp3\n19 That wasn&amp;#039;t her toe, Dude.mp3\n20 We cut off your johnson.mp3\n21 They got us working in shifts.mp3\n22 I could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug.mp3\n23 Sometimes you eat the bar.mp3\n24 This is a very complicated case.mp3\n25 Could you slide your shorts down.mp3\n26 Lookin&amp;#039; Out My Backdoor - Larry&amp;#039;s homework.mp3\n27 Marty&amp;#039;s dance quintet.mp3\n28 Is this your homework Larry.mp3\n29 Put your diapers on Lebowski.mp3\n30 What condition my condition was in - Kafka Break No.2.mp3\n31 I don&amp;#039;t like your jerkoff name.mp3\n32 Jesus, man, could you change the channel.mp3\n33 Jeffrey - Maude - Love me - That&amp;#039;s my rob.mp3\n34 How are you gonna keep &amp;#039;em down on the farm.mp3\n35 Pigs in blankets.mp3\n36 Three thousand years of beautiful tradition.mp3\n37 All you needed was a sap to pin it on.mp3\n38 Who&amp;#039;s in pajamas Walter.mp3\n39 We vants the money, Lebowski.mp3\n40 It is our most modestly priced receptacle.mp3\n41 Donny was a good bowler and a good man.mp3\n42 Dead Flowers - Yea, well, the Dude abides.mp3\n43 The Dude, takin&amp;#039; &amp;#039;er easy for all us sinners - Dead Flowers - End credits.mp3\n44 Viva Las Vegas - Final credits.mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7827cfa083eed8f6e72e7a4e2dc7485e2ef6d6a8","amp;dn":"The+Big+Lebowski+%28complete+audio+track%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7827cfa083eed8f6e72e7a4e2dc7485e2ef6d6a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,39,207,160,131,238,216,246,231,46,122,78,45,199,72,94,46,246,214,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Sunday I look at seven MYTHS... LIES... AND COMPLETE STUPIDITIES:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FOOD... MYTH: Government should help people make healthy choices for themselves. TRUTH: The nanny state reduces your freedom while accomplishing little.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ MAIL... MYTH: The post office should deliver the mail. TRUTH: The private sector does it better.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FRACKING... MYTH: Fracking is dangerous. TRUTH: Fracking is dangerous but can easily be safely managed, and fracking has done more to help the environment than all the &quot;green&quot; energy sources combined (it replaces dirtier gasoline and coal.)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ LAWSUITS... MYTH: Lawsuits protect consumers. TRUTH: Lawsuits make valuable products cost more.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ HEALTHCARE... MYTH: Obamacare is good for business. TRUTH: Government intervention kills innovation. Kills jobs too.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ INFRASTRUCTURE... MYTH: Government must build infrastructure. TRUTH: Business builds it better.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ IMPERIAL WASHINGTON... MYTH: Washington D.C. is about serving the public. TRUTH: DC is about empire building.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8283205481c1ed0b89244fe0e14bfbe6d0700084","amp;dn":"Stossel.2013.08.22.%5BMyths+Lies+and+Complete+Stupidity%5D.FBN.CF.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8283205481c1ed0b89244fe0e14bfbe6d0700084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,131,32,84,129,193,237,11,137,36,79,224,225,75,251,230,208,112,0,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

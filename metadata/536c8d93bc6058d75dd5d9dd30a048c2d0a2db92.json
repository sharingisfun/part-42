With sweeping cinematography and rich, dramatic reenactments soaked in 18th Century detail, we will trace Catherine's journey from a humble, impoverished home in Germany to the throne of an empire that spanned two- thirds of the globe. We will follow the empress to war, to court, and even to bed. From the scorched battlefields of the Crimea to the gilded palaces of St. Petersburg, we will venture deep into the world of the Empress Catherine - a world of secret trysts and cunning deception, of conquest and glory - and bring to life the characters and events that shaped her reign.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536c8d93bc6058d75dd5d9dd30a048c2d0a2db92","amp;dn":"Icons+of+Power%3A++Catherine+the+Great+++%28National+Geographic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536c8d93bc6058d75dd5d9dd30a048c2d0a2db92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,108,141,147,188,96,88,215,93,213,217,221,48,160,72,194,208,162,219,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just summarily lump New Zealand in with Australian country music either, but truth be known, that entire quadrant of the globe deserves more credit for their country music contributions than it regularly gets. Rugged, rural country produces the sound of a strained heart that is universal in its appeal regardless of what hemisphere it originates in.\n\nBut it just happens to be that Tami Neilson originally originated from North America. And get this, she even has country music skins on the wall. Growing up in Canada, Tami played in the Neilson Family Band that toured regularly and even opened for Johnny Cash and others. More recently sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s played with Emmylou Harris and Pokey LaFarge. But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not pretend that Tami is one of these artists you have to associate with other more well-known names just to get you interested. Her music speaks for itself.\n\ntami-nelson-dynamiteYour brain is going to want to file Tami Neilson into the rockabilly lobe initially because of the angry bangs sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rocking on the album cover and the rockabilly-ish opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk (Back To Your Arms),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and no doubt thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a healthy dollop of that old school rock and roll vibe in her sound. But country is the most resounding influence on her new record Dynamite! released in March, and quite honestly her offerings dwarf many, if not most of the contributions from artists residing in country musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s native geography.\n\nFrankly, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a little intimidated about where to start raining praises on this record, but letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s begin with TamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice. Like a country music genetic experiment gone good, Tami Neilson sounds like the result of Patsy Cline and Wanda Jackson having a baby. Blow off everything else if you wish, but Dynamite! might be the best vocal performance turned in for quite a while. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cry Over YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is downright shiver inducing, and shows itself as a strong contender for Song of the Year.\n\nThat leads us into a discussion on the sheer style of TamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. This is totally a country throwback old-school 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s record with no tone or sentiment offered foreign to this time, and no anachronism overlooked. At the same time the songs are timeless, speaking to the modern heart as universally as they would have if they were released 60+ years ago. A big hand needs to be given to producers Ben Edwards and Delaney Davidson, the latter known for touring the U.S. regularly with Possessed by Paul James. So many albums try to evoke the throwback sound with close approximations of vintage tones and by simply relying on tubes and tape instead of true interpretations of styles. Just like TamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing, if nothing else, Dynamite! might be one of the best-produced albums in recent memory. And not just in the tones, but in the instrumental performances themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€the arrangements, the classic electric guitar, the pedal steel and fiddle. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all so splendidly compiled and blended to inflict the intended mood.\n\nBut you know how modern country fans love to complain about music that sounds just like grandpaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where Tami NeilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting comes in, making Dynamite! so much more than just a cool nostalgia record. Like any good country album, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moments where the songs simply pound at your emotional capacitors and make you relent; songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Lie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Running To You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whiskey and Kisses.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Take these songs and overlay them with a hip-hop beat and they would still work brilliantly. Yes, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of interpretation of style instead of originality on this album with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“TexasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that could have been ripped out of Patsy ClineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song chronology, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Woo Hoo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is just fun silliness. But a song like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Running To YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ exhibits a lot of deep compositional brilliance.\n\nThere may be some songs here that are just simply fun, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a slouch in the entire bunch. And this album goes by so fast, like a succulent daydream you wake up too early from and try to fall back asleep to recapture. Luckily this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t 1954 and we have the aid of a repeat button.\n\nCanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say enough here. This is a good one, and a late edition to the albums that are being considered as the best in country music in 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43826e2bdda7cdb94d6c8bcdc87264a38c5a474","amp;dn":"Tami+Neilson+-+Dynamite%21+%5B2014%5D+%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43826e2bdda7cdb94d6c8bcdc87264a38c5a474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,56,38,226,189,218,124,219,148,214,200,188,220,135,38,74,56,197,164,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

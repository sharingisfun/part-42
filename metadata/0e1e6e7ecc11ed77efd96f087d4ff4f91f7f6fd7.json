Tora! Tora! is a 1970 American-Japanese film that dramatizes the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to the extent these facts were known at the time of production.\n\nThe commanders in Hawaii, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, though scapegoated for decades, are portrayed as taking defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese insurgents. They received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack, which was better understood in Washington than in Honolulu. The film is famous for Isoroku Yamamoto's quote likening the attacks to &quot;awakening a sleeping giant&quot;, although it may have been fictitious.\n\nThe title is made up of the code-words that were used by the Japanese to indicate that complete surprise was achieved and is translated in the Japanese as &quot;ÃƒÂ¨Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã…Â½&quot; or &quot;tiger&quot;, hence making the code for achieved surprise &quot;Tiger, tiger, tiger&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tora!_Tora!_Tora!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tora!_Tora!_Tora!&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=shot0004m.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=shot0004m.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1e6e7ecc11ed77efd96f087d4ff4f91f7f6fd7","amp;dn":"Tora%21+Tora%21+Tora%21+%281970%29+World+War+II+movie+H264+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1e6e7ecc11ed77efd96f087d4ff4f91f7f6fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,30,110,126,204,17,237,119,239,217,111,8,125,79,244,249,31,127,111,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

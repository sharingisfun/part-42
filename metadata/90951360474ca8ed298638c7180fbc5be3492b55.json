The original rip is very smooth and dynamic, but I wanted a different sound from it, closer to that of the retail CD, with a more direct, punchy, I guess &quot;traditional&quot; rock sound. The vinyl rip is quite bass heavy with the guitars not very present.\n\nSince it is a vinyl rip I worked to more closely match the frequency response of each track with respect to the others, since vinyl tends to have varying EQ response depending on where on the vinyl the track is located. I also changed the overall EQ curve to weight the sound more towards the mid-section.\n\nSome subtle and very unintrusive dynamics processing has been made aswell to liven the tracks up slightly more. This is not compression though, the dynamic range of the tracks is completely intact, expanded slightly in fact, and not a peak has been touched or limited.\n\nThe result is a mix with more presence, a more controlled bass response, weighted more toward sections of the spectrum that have a bit more dynamics to them, and a more uniform sound across the album. Hopefully it should give a bit more bite to the songs, while still being very smooth and natural-sounding.\n\nI hope this might be of benefit to someone, and do give me your comments and criticism if you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90951360474ca8ed298638c7180fbc5be3492b55","amp;dn":"A+Perfect+Circle+-+Mer+De+Noms+2000+%28Vinyl+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90951360474ca8ed298638c7180fbc5be3492b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,149,19,96,71,76,168,237,41,134,56,199,24,15,188,91,227,73,43,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's the gold standard!&quot; Women have a largely unknown network of structures responsible for arousal and orgasm that their owners and even most medical professionals don't know about. We're not just talking about Ye Olde G-Spot here. Women have an entire erectile network that, if properly stimulated, can elevate their erotic experience from &quot;Oh!&quot; to &quot;Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; Join celebrated sexuality teacher Sheri Winston as she integrates ancient wisdom, lost knowledge and modern sexuality information in a sexy, fun, empowering guidebook that illuminates every woman's secret paths to fabulous, orgasmically abundant sex. Whether you're a woman or a man who loves women, this book is for you! There's great information here, but that's not why Winston wrote the book. She wrote it to transform people's lives and support them to reclaim their erotic birthright. And what she shares works! When people apply the information and techniques she provides, the result is often a whole new level of sexual pleasure. Many women experience their first ejaculations and/or become multi- or mega-orgasmic. Men learn how to make their female partner REALLY happy. Women's Anatomy of Arousal includes discussions of anatomy and energetics, female ejaculation and expanded orgasm, and much more. It's packed with sidebars providing great tips to women and their lovers. There's even a short chapter for guys (&quot;The Easy Girl's Guide to Making It Easy for Guys&quot;) summarizing the main points of the book! Winston's background includes over twenty years as a nurse-midwife, gynecology practitioner and student of the ancient erotic traditions. Over the years, she has developed her own unique approach to sexuality education, called Wholistic Sexuality. She gets rave reviews as a teacher. Now her teaching is available in this fun, fascinating, immensely readable book that can transform your sex life for the better. Winston is the executive director of the Kingston, NY-based Center for the Intimate Arts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e075286e2521524290ba2cc7363229987871c621","amp;dn":"Woman%27s+Anatomy+of+Arousal+-+Sheri+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e075286e2521524290ba2cc7363229987871c621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,117,40,110,37,33,82,66,144,186,44,199,54,50,41,152,120,113,198,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

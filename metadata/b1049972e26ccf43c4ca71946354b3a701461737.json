By examining radiocarbon (C-14) datingÃ¢â‚¬â€the best known of these methodsÃ¢â‚¬â€and several other techniques that geologists use to decode the distant past, Macdougall unwraps the last century's advances, explaining how they reveal the age of our fossil ancestors such as &quot;Lucy,&quot; the timing of the dinosaurs' extinction, and the precise ages of tiny mineral grains that date from the beginning of the earth's history. In lively and accessible prose, he describes how the science of geochronology has developed and flourished. Relating these advances through the stories of the scientists themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€James Hutton, William Smith, Arthur Holmes, Ernest Rutherford, Willard Libby, and Clair PattersonÃ¢â‚¬â€Macdougall shows how they used ingenuity and inspiration to construct one of modern science's most significant accomplishments: a timescale for the earth's evolution and human prehistory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1049972e26ccf43c4ca71946354b3a701461737","amp;dn":"Nature%26rsquo%3Bs+Clocks+-+How+Scientists+Measure+the+Age+of+Almost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1049972e26ccf43c4ca71946354b3a701461737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,4,153,114,226,108,207,67,196,202,113,148,99,84,179,167,1,70,23,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Spicy sriracha sauce. Honeycrisp apples. Cupcakes. These days, it seems we are constantly discovering a new food that will make us healthier, happier, or even somehow cooler. Chia seeds, after a brief life as a novelty houseplant and I Love the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s punchline, are suddenly a superfood. Not long ago, that same distinction was held by pomegranate seeds, aÃƒÂ§ai berries, and the fermented drink known as kombucha. So what happened? Did these foods suddenly cease to be healthy a few years ago? And by the way, what exactly is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“superfoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ again?\n\nIn this eye-opening, witty work of reportage, David Sax uncovers the world of food trends: Where they come from, how they grow, and where they end up. Traveling from the South Carolina rice plot of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier grain guru to ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gluttonous Baconfest, Sax reveals a world of influence, money, and activism that helps decide what goes on your plate. On his journey, he meets entrepreneurs, chefs, and even data analysts who have made food trends a mission and a business. The Tastemakers is full of entertaining stories and surprising truths about what we eat, how we eat it, and why.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef420aee35bbf17b82c4188f4e2c6afd590e9061","amp;dn":"David+Sax+-+The+Tastemakers-+Why+We%27re+Crazy+for+Cupcakes+but+Fe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef420aee35bbf17b82c4188f4e2c6afd590e9061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,66,10,238,53,187,241,123,130,196,24,143,78,44,106,253,89,14,144,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

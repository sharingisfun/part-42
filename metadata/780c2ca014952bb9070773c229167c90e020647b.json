In Tamil it was made as Adhe Kangal. The movie was intriguing right from start to end. It is a murder mystery and the characters were getting murdered one after another.\n\nThe story revolves around a family where each and every person in that family were being murdered by a serial killer. A special officer (Krishna) will be appointed to find out the mystery behind these murders. He finally succeeds in finding the killer. There were some funny sequences which can be avoided, but all in all a great movie. Highly recommended for the fans of this genre.\n\nRich and pretty, Susila returns from college to find that her family is being bumped off one by one. The only clues are a half smoked cigar left at the scene of each murder and a mysterious woman in white running through the courtyard. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: Xvid ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 714 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: Telugu\nRunTime: 2:46:07\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]     \nDuration: 2:46:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780c2ca014952bb9070773c229167c90e020647b","amp;dn":"Ave+Kallu+%281967%29+Telugu+Xvid+2cd+-+No+Subs+-+Krishna%2C+Kanchana+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780c2ca014952bb9070773c229167c90e020647b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,12,44,160,20,149,43,185,7,7,115,194,41,22,124,144,224,32,100,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

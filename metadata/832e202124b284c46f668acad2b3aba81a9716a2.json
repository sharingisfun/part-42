They have sold over 27 million albums worldwide since forming in Poway, California in 1992. With original drummer Scott Raynor they released their debut album Cheshire Cat in 1994 and achieved moderate success with its follow-up, 1997's Dude Ranch, which went on to sell over one million copies. Raynor was replaced by Barker midway through a 1998 tour.\n\nThe band achieved greater success with 1999's multi-platinum selling Enema of the State, which reached number 9 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles &quot;What's My Age Again&quot; and &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, the latter of which became the highest-charting song of their career by reaching number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blink-182 gained popularity for their irreverent sense of humor, and the follow-up album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) reached number 1 in the United States, Canada, and Germany. The eponymously-titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk formula resulting in a more mature sound.\n\nDeLonge left Blink-182 in early 2005, sending the band into indefinite hiatus. He went on to form Angels &amp; Airwaves while Hoppus and Barker formed +44. Hoppus also pursued a career as a television host while Barker continued working in music as a producer and solo artist. Blink-182 reunited in February 2009 and their sixth studio album, Neighborhoods, was released in September 2011.\n\nCheshire Cat\n1. &quot;Carousel&quot; 3:14\n2. &quot;M+M's&quot; 2:39\n3. &quot;Fentoozler&quot; 2:04\n4. &quot;Touchdown Boy&quot; 3:10\n5. &quot;Strings&quot; 2:25\n6. &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; 2:38\n7. &quot;Sometimes&quot; 1:08\n8. &quot;Does My Breath Smell?&quot; 2:38\n9. &quot;Cacophony&quot; 3:05\n10. &quot;TV&quot; 1:41\n11. &quot;Toast and Bananas&quot; 2:42\n12. &quot;Wasting Time&quot; 2:49\n13. &quot;Romeo and Rebecca&quot; 2:34\n14. &quot;Ben Wah Balls&quot; 3:55\n15. &quot;Just About Done&quot; 2:16\n16. &quot;Depends&quot; 2:48\nTotal length: 41:46\n\nDude Ranch\n1. &quot;Pathetic&quot; 2:27\n2. &quot;Voyeur&quot; 2:43\n3. &quot;Dammit&quot; 2:45\n4. &quot;Boring&quot; 1:41\n5. &quot;Dick Lips&quot; 2:57\n6. &quot;Waggy&quot; 3:16\n7. &quot;Enthused&quot; 2:48\n8. &quot;Untitled&quot; 2:46\n9. &quot;Apple Shampoo&quot; 2:52\n10. &quot;Emo&quot; 2:50\n11. &quot;Josie&quot; 3:20\n12. &quot;A New Hope&quot; 3:45\n13. &quot;Degenerate&quot; 2:28\n14. &quot;Lemmings&quot; 2:38\n15. &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; 5:37\nTotal length: 44:53\n\nEnema Of The State\n1. &quot;Dumpweed&quot; 2:23\n2. &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot; 2:23\n3. &quot;Aliens Exist&quot; 3:13\n4. &quot;Going Away to College&quot; 2:59\n5. &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; 2:28\n6. &quot;Dysentery Gary&quot; 2:45\n7. &quot;Adam's Song&quot; 4:09\n8. &quot;All the Small Things&quot; 2:48\n9. &quot;The Party Song&quot; 2:19\n10. &quot;Mutt&quot; 3:23\n11. &quot;Wendy Clear&quot; 2:50\n12. &quot;Anthem&quot; 3:37\nTotal length: 35:17\n\nThe Mark, Tom &amp; Travis Show\n1. &quot;Dumpweed&quot; 2:53\n2. &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot; 2:38\n3. &quot;Aliens Exist&quot; 3:43\n4. &quot;Family Reunion&quot; 0:51\n5. &quot;Going Away to College&quot; 3:40\n6. &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; 3:18\n7. &quot;Dick Lips&quot; 3:35\n8. &quot;Blow Job&quot; 0:41\n9. &quot;Untitled&quot; 3:07\n10. &quot;Voyeur&quot; 3:28\n11. &quot;Pathetic&quot; 2:51\n12. &quot;Adam's Song&quot; 4:35\n13. &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; 3:47\n14. &quot;Wendy Clear&quot; 4:09\n15. &quot;Carousel&quot; 3:38\n16. &quot;All the Small Things&quot; 3:35\n17. &quot;Mutt&quot; 3:39\n18. &quot;The Country Song&quot; 1:00\n19. &quot;Dammit&quot; 3:05\n20. &quot;Man Overboard [Album Version]&quot; 2:46\nTotal length: 61:52\n\n*this torrent includes bonus tracks of Mark &amp; Tom saying funny things*\n\nTake Off Your Pants and Jacket\n1. &quot;Anthem Part Two&quot; 3:48\n2. &quot;Online Songs&quot; 2:25\n3. &quot;First Date&quot; 2:51\n4. &quot;Happy Holidays, You Bastard&quot; 0:42\n5. &quot;Story of a Lonely Guy&quot; 3:39\n6. &quot;The Rock Show&quot; 2:51\n7. &quot;Stay Together for the Kids&quot; 3:59\n8. &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; 2:47\n9. &quot;Reckless Abandon&quot; 3:06\n10. &quot;Everytime I Look for You&quot; 3:05\n11. &quot;Give Me One Good Reason&quot; 3:18\n12. &quot;Shut Up&quot; 3:20\n13. &quot;Please Take Me Home&quot; 3:05\nTotal length: 38:56\n\nBlink 182\n1. &quot;Feeling This&quot; 2:53\n2. &quot;Obvious&quot; 2:43\n3. &quot;I Miss You&quot; 3:47\n4. &quot;Violence&quot; 5:20\n5. &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; 2:42\n6. &quot;Down&quot; 3:03\n7. &quot;The Fallen Interlude&quot; 2:13\n8. &quot;Go&quot; 1:53\n9. &quot;Asthenia&quot; 4:20\n10. &quot;Always&quot; 4:12\n11. &quot;Easy Target&quot; 2:20\n12. &quot;All of This&quot; 4:40\n13. &quot;Here's Your Letter&quot; 2:55\n14. &quot;I'm Lost Without You&quot; 6:22\nTotal length: 49:23\n\nNeighborhoods\n1. &quot;Ghost on the Dance Floor&quot; 4:17\n2. &quot;Natives&quot; 3:55\n3. &quot;Up All Night&quot; 3:20\n4. &quot;After Midnight&quot; 3:25\n5. &quot;Heart's All Gone&quot; 3:15\n6. &quot;Wishing Well&quot; 3:20\n7. &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; 3:52\n8. &quot;This Is Home&quot; 2:46\n9. &quot;MH 4.18.2011&quot; 3:27\n10. &quot;Love Is Dangerous&quot; 4:27\nTotal length: 36:04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832e202124b284c46f668acad2b3aba81a9716a2","amp;dn":"Blink+182+Discography+-+Apple+Lossless+-+CR%40%24H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832e202124b284c46f668acad2b3aba81a9716a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,46,32,33,36,178,132,196,111,102,138,202,210,179,171,168,26,151,22,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Snapping hard at the heals of the sublime \\\\\\'El Dia Perfecto\\\\\\' single (think chilled Underworld vocoder over vigorous Brazilian percussive workout), the album shows that he has much more to offer. \\\\\\'Melodious Funk\\\\\\' using THAT Gangstarr sample, the expressive jazzy house of \\\\\\'Cosmic Echoes\\\\\\', the 4 Hero-esque orchestral ambience of \\\\\\'Mindscape\\\\\\', and the intense percussive deluge of \\\\\\'Motherland\\\\\\'. Check it. Straight No Chaser, Sept 2000\n\n...Call it nu-jazz, call it nu-house, call it future-jazz - in fact, call it what you want. I\\\\\\'m sticking with the words \\\\\\'awesome\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'genius\\\\\\'. 9/10 Wax Magazine\n\nFuture funk from keyboardist Mark De Clive-Lowe -- a stunning blend of retro influences and forward thinking rhythms -- all filtered down into one incredibly hip album of instrumental tracks that almost sound like a 21st Century take on soul jazz! The album\\\\\\'s got some nicely percolated beats -- almost London broken, but not quite out there -- more inside, which provides a perfect place for Mark to open up on the keys -- skipping a groove nicely on a mix of Fender Rhodes and other keyboards! Dustygrooves.com \n\nProduced by Mark de Clive-Lowe for Melodius Productions\nCo-produced by Submariner, Manuel Bundy and Joost Langeveld\n\nFeaturing Cherie Mathieson [voc], Teremoana Rapley [voc], King Kapisi [voc], Juan Muzzio [perc], Lewis McCallum [fl], Lance Bentley [d], Manuel Bundy [turntables]\n\n100% New Zealand Music\n______________________________________________________\n\nFYI:\nWhile much New Zealand music is well known at home, in the greater world few are familiar with our household names.  This results in relatively little activity on this and other NZ music torrents.\nFurthermore- In NZ we have broadband capacity and speed limits, while in most of the rest of the world (particularly Europe and America) there are no bandwidth restrictions.\nThese two factors make it difficult to seed new NZ music torrents from NZ.  It is particularly frustrating when leechers in restrictionless countries do not seed back what they download because that makes keeping the torrent alive a slow and costly task.\nPleeeeaaase- help support this torrent by seeding it back for as long as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecdc7eefe29a14cac79a863abe72a578156a75f","amp;dn":"Mark+De+Clive-Lowe+-+Six+Degrees","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ecdc7eefe29a14cac79a863abe72a578156a75f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,205,199,238,254,41,161,76,172,121,168,99,171,231,42,87,129,86,167,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I just listened to them and I believe it is back when I had borrowed a friends keyboard when I first realized I knew how to play a little. The piano sounded so bad to me when I just played it that I wanted to post this.\nIn my poetry I try and follow what Browning said about poetry being a silent echo reminding the reader of something you wanted to emphasize. I like syncopation in good rock. It kind of brings a sense of falling apart. If I remember right it involves the bass and drums on a steady beat and the rhythm guitar off by and eight note or so which cause a feeling of being held together by a string. I try and use Browning's ideas of near rhymes to emphasis that sense of rhythm in a type of waning of consonance and dissonance. I am trying to do the same thing on the piano. I don't know if it works but I am learning.\n    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6709e857277bc975fc89460ca3fcd1c571ed94d2","amp;dn":"Something+Borrowed.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6709e857277bc975fc89460ca3fcd1c571ed94d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,9,232,87,39,123,201,117,252,137,70,12,163,252,209,197,113,237,148,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

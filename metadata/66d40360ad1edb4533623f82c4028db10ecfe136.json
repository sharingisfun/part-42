He does know, however, that he adamantly hates the witches of Kymru. When he becomes Warleader of Corania, he sets the might of his empire against them and their country. Gwydion the Dreamer and his friend Rhiannon travel to Corania to spy on Havgan after Gwydion's dream reveals Havgan's imperialistic desires. In their frantic attempt to save Kymru, they risk everything. But when a thoughtless action threatens to doom them all, Gwydion and Rhiannon must fight not only to discover Havgan's secret but also to understand why Havgan seems so hauntingly familiar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d40360ad1edb4533623f82c4028db10ecfe136","amp;dn":"Crimson+Fire+%5BThe+Dreamer%27s+Cycle%2C+%232%5D+-+Holly+Taylor.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d40360ad1edb4533623f82c4028db10ecfe136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,212,3,96,173,30,219,69,51,98,63,130,196,2,141,177,14,207,225,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

They play loud fast music, described as Mountainbilly, a mix of true American roots mountain music mixed with rockabilly influences. Real as yer busted heart and empty wallet...\n\n- The most honest and pure group to come around in ages. If Woody Guthrie had more balls and was fueled by piss and vinegar, you would have Highlonesome. Great band, great songs - \n\n.357 String Band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f3982cd00800dc8738cb81701698a8518a2a6d","amp;dn":"Highlonesome+-+Highlonesome+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f3982cd00800dc8738cb81701698a8518a2a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,243,152,44,208,8,0,220,135,56,203,129,112,22,152,168,81,138,42,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

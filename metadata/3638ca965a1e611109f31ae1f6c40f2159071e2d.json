Directed by Petr Zelenka with the soundtrack by Oscar-winning Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, it tells a story of Czech actors who come to Polish steelworks to perform Dostojevski's The Brothers Karamazov at an alternative drama festival. As rehearsals get under way, we follow not only the emotional story examining issues of faith, immortality and the salvation of the human soul, but also the relationships within the acting troupe itself, which strangely reflect DostojevskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;great&quot; themes. The stage drama is transferred to the real world when a tragedy occurs during rehearsal involving one of the spectators. Karamazovi won the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) award in Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2008 and has been submitted by The Czech Republic for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\n  Martin Mysicka  ...

Stary Karamazov  \n\nThose with a taste for life on the dark side will devour Petr Zelenka's The Karamazovs with evil gusto.\n\nThe set up involves a large European arts grant resulting in bringing a Czech theatre troupe to Poland as part of the Closer to Life Festival. They will perform a theatrical version of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's infamous novel, The Brothers Karamazov. \n\nThe wide variety of acts (including a Pas de deux and magical puppet show) will be staged in and around a steel factory whose long history has included owners from Germany and Russia before the present Indian steel baron took over the helm of sweaty commerce.\n\nThe storied plot unfolds in the wide-open venue, the likes of which those confined to a real theatre can only envy. Using the sprawling workplace and environs, the scenes unfold with extra-visual depth that is at one with the exceptional skills of the players (not the least of which are Radek Holub's portrayal of the epileptic semi-son, Smerdyakov and thegripping characterization of his soulless father by Ivan Trojan).\n\nThe Rozbitel Orchestra renders Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score (largely piano and strings) with aplombÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Marek Szpakiewicz's cello contributions are especially fineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even as the music remembers BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k and Russian folk songs (the cocktail piano bits also can't fail to bring a smile).\n\nAs this life-imitates-art-imitates-death production reaches its difficult end, the original material seems stronger than ever. The tale of My Four Sons, debts owed and competing for the same women (Michaela BadinkovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ and Lenka KrobotovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡) remains as compelling and timeless as ever. Even the cinematic treatment (Alexander Surkala proves to be a first-class cinematographer) can't overshadow the novelist's masterful intent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3638ca965a1e611109f31ae1f6c40f2159071e2d","amp;dn":"Karamazovi+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2008%5D+Petr+Zelenka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3638ca965a1e611109f31ae1f6c40f2159071e2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,56,202,150,90,30,97,17,9,243,26,225,246,196,15,33,89,7,30,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

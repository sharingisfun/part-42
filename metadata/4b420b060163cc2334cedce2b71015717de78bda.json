That it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for one of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit &quot;After Midnight,&quot; was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I Shot The Sheriff\n02.After Midnight\n03.Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n04.Wonderful Tonight\n05.Layla (Derek &amp; The Dominoes)\n06.Cocaine\n07.Lay Down Sally\n08.Willie And The Hand Jive\n09.Promises\n10.Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\n11.Let It Grow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b420b060163cc2334cedce2b71015717de78bda","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Timepieces+Best+Of++%281982%29+CBR320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b420b060163cc2334cedce2b71015717de78bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,66,11,6,1,99,204,35,52,206,220,226,183,16,21,113,125,231,139,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In this course, Dr. Todd Dewett explains the specific physical cues that project intelligence and suggests behaviors you can adopt to make a good first impression, such as effectively listening, admitting your imperfections, and speaking modestly but authoritatively. He also helps you understand how appearance and body language impact how other people think about you, and avoid common tactical mistakes.\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01049a39b4b83f341a2f6a0908e63334da8e3f0","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Projecting+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01049a39b4b83f341a2f6a0908e63334da8e3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,16,73,163,155,75,131,243,65,162,246,160,144,142,99,51,77,168,227,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Though the retail is \nout since the 26th of april, seems nobody bother to buy it or \nrelease it. Ofcourse you favorite hardcore group won't let a \nrelease like this go away. From midtown:\n\n''On Saturday the 23rd of April 2011, the Ahoy venue in Rotterdam \nwas transformed yet again into the infamous annual hardcore \nplatform that is Nightmare. Against a backdrop of impressive \ndecoration and musically supported by the whoÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s who of the \nhardcore industry, thousands of hardcore heads were collectively \nundergoing over nine hours of early rave and present hardcore \ninsanity. As the unwritten Nightmare law constitutes, two \nNightmare headliners received the assignment to compile and mix \nthe traditional Nightmare compilation.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Producing an anthem for a Nightmare event pays offÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, Weapon X \nmust have thought. And if a Nightmare anthem is thÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸t good, itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s \nbound to happen you also get asked to compile the official \nNightmare compilation. With his production Hell Awaits, \nWeapon X finds himself in an illustrious group of Nightmare anthem\nproviders. With his unique choice of hardcore battle weapons, \nWeapon X selected 22 present hardcore masterpieces for disc one \nby a.o. Evil Activities &amp; Endymion, D-Passion, Nosferatu, \nRuffneck, Angerfist and Ophidian, next to his own creations.\n\nIf you say early rave, you say Forze DJ Team. As the Forze DJ \nTeam single handedly invented the early rave genre with their \noutstanding resume of releases, this notorious team of \nRotterdam DJÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s had the honor to close off the early rave stage \nduring Nightmare. Forze DJ Team member DJ Lars was up to the \ntask to capture the essence of early rave onto disc number two. \nTunes such as Gangster Shit, 909 Trauma, Party Rico, Fuck You \nMan, Alkaline 3DH, Young Birds, Dumcore and many more represent \nan ultimate early rave collection, all blended in a furious \n22-track DJ mix.''\n\nNothing more to add, enjoy!\n\n\n_________________________[ Tracklist ]____________________________\n\n\nCD 1/2\n\n1.

They and the other band members describe the concert and the making of Prairie Wind. The recording of the album and the filming of the concert occurred just before and after Young\\'s surgery to correct a cerebral aneurysm, and just a few months after the death of Young\\'s father Scott Young.\n\nThe first half of the concert consists entirely of songs from Prairie Wind, and the second half consists of acoustic songs from throughout Young\\'s career. Young describes the inspiration behind several of his songs.\nSongs in the film:\n\nThe performance captured in Neil Young: Heart of Gold was filmed over two nights on August 18 and 19 2005 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. In order to increase the length of the concert film, director Jonathan Demme asked Neil Young to supplement the songs from Prairie Wind with an encore set of older songs. Young agreed and selected songs that he had previously recorded in Nashville. The two sets are set apart by a costume change for the musicians and a different backdrop on the stage.\n\n Prairie Wind set\n\n    * \\&quot;The Painter\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;No Wonder\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ featuring Neil Young\\'s longtime friend Grant         Boatwright playing \\&quot;Old Black\\&quot;,\n    * \\&quot;Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Far From Home\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;It\\'s a Dream\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Prairie Wind\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Here for You\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;This Old Guitar\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ duet with Emmylou Harris\n    * \\&quot;When God Made Me\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ features Young playing piano, backed by the Fisk University Jubilee Singers and Spooner Oldham on organ.\nEncore set:\n\n    * \\&quot;I Am a Child\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Harvest Moon\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Heart of Gold\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Old Man\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;The Needle and the Damage Done\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Old King\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ features Young on six-string banjo, accompanied by Emmylou Harris on rhythm guitar and harmony vocals.\n    * \\&quot;Comes a Time\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;Four Strong Winds\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ written by Ian Tyson.\n    * \\&quot;One of These Days\\&quot;\n    * \\&quot;The Old Laughing Lady\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ over the closing credits; Young on solo acoustic guitar, alone on stage in a chair, playing to an empty auditorium.\n\nDVD special features:\n\n    * \\&quot;He was the King\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A bonus song from Prairie Wind, not included in the film.\n    * \\&quot;Needle and the Damage Done\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1971 performance from The Johnny Cash Show.\n*6 extensive documentaries\nINFO &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473692/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473692/&lt;/a&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENJOY THE SHOW :)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152c802e6329b21d2901e63f85ec489a606370c7","amp;dn":"neil+young+heart+of+gold+%2B+specials%282+dvd+nl+sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152c802e6329b21d2901e63f85ec489a606370c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,44,128,46,99,41,178,29,41,1,230,63,133,236,72,154,96,99,112,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

(from IMDb)\n\n***\n\nWim Wenders says,\n\\&quot;Fashion. I\\'ll have nothing of it. At least that\nwas my first reaction when the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris asked me to make a short film\nin the context of fashion.\\&quot;\n\n\\&quot;The world of fashion.\nI\\'m interested in the world, not in fashion! But, maybe I was too quick to put down fashion. Why\nnot look at it without prejudice? Why not examine\nit like any other industry, like the movies\nfor example?\\&quot;\n\n\\&quot;Maybe fashion and cinema had something\nin common. And something else -- this film would\ngive me the opportunity to meet someone who\nhad already aroused my curiosity, someone\nwho worked in Tokyo [Fashion designer\nYohji Yamamoto].\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b929544ee5ac3885e9a9e442111cae5304d2af","amp;dn":"Notebook+on+Cities+and+Clothes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b929544ee5ac3885e9a9e442111cae5304d2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,185,41,84,78,229,172,56,133,233,169,228,66,17,28,174,83,4,210,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

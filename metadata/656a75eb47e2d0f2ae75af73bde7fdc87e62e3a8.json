Having created the incorporated church, the State governs them via corporate law and public policy, grants and revokes privileges, burdens them, restricts them, penalizes them, and can dissolve them.\n When incorporated, the church has two masters; the Bible and now the State that controls the church via corporate law and public policy.\n The incorporated church has ignored Jesus' warnings in Luke 16:13 &amp; Matthew 6:24 about the impossibility of serving two masters and the consequences thereof.\n If that weren't enough, now the church must go to the IRS on hands and knees, begging to be a tax exempt, 501(c)3 religious organization. Money is paid, and typically scribes are hired to complete this process. Now beholden to the IRS for its tax exempt status, the IRS dictates to the 501(c)3 church, (See Page 3 of the IRS Tax Guide for Churches and Religious Organizations) that:\n 1. &quot;No substantial part of its [the churches] activity may be attempting to influence legislation.&quot;\n 2. &quot;The organization [church] may not intervene in political campaigns&quot;\n At this point the church has taken on a third master, the IRS.\nThe church cannot serve two masters especially when Christ tells them to be salt and preserve society and the IRS tells them to stay out of the political arena and become irrelevant - which they have done. Having obeyed the IRS rather than the Bible, they have become irrelevant, savorless salt, good for nothing but tyranny - which they have allowed to come upon them and the rest of the country by their inaction. The church in America had the power to hold the government accountable to a higher law that prevented corruption. It has forfeited its power by disobeying the direct commands and warnings of Jesus. Consequently, the civil powers are well on their way to corruption, tyranny and enthroning themselves as the highest authority - above God and above the will of the people themselves. The civil authorities have become masters rather than servants.\n\nThis 160 page book is the most in-depth exposÃƒÂ¨ that has ever been written on the legal and theological pitfalls and perils of church incorporation and the IRS 501c3 tax-exempt status. Includes valuable historic information regarding the origins of the corporation and why the early church was accused of civil disobedience for refusing to incorporate.\n\nAlso includes the historic influence of the &quot;nonconformist&quot; clergy (branded the &quot;Black Regiment&quot; by King George), without whom it is inconceivable that America would have ever declared independency.\n\nChapter Titles:\n  1.

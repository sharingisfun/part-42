CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS is highly regarded because this text offers a balance of theory and conceptual work to satisfy more progressive programs as well as those who are more comfortable teaching in a more traditional fashion. Each title is just one component in a comprehensive calculus course program that carefully integrates and coordinates print, media, and technology products for successful teaching and learning.\nAbout the Author\nJames Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford. Stewart is currently a Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University. His research field is harmonic analysis. James Stewart is the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Brooks/Cole, including CALCULUS, Fifth Edition and CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, Fifth Edition, as well as a series of precalculus texts. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 978 pages\n    * Publisher: Brooks Cole; 4 edition (March 9, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0495557420\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0495557425","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee8ab6b8c2f9cc8087dc4a2a51cf09e20774dd9","amp;dn":"Calculus+-+Concepts+and+Contexts+4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee8ab6b8c2f9cc8087dc4a2a51cf09e20774dd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,232,171,107,140,47,156,200,8,125,196,162,165,28,240,158,32,119,77,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

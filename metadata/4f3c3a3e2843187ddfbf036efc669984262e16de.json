According to the band, they chose the name 'April Wine' simply because members thought the two words sounded good together. The band has released more than 20 albums and continues to attract fans to its concerts, within and without Canada, more than 40 years after its beginning as a hard rock group.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLive at the El Mocambo is the second live album by the Canadian rock band April Wine, released in 1977. It was recorded during a performance at Toronto's El Mocambo club when April Wine opened for the Rolling Stones during one of the surprise club appearances for which the Stones are renowned, and during which they recorded part of their own live album &quot;Love You Live&quot; (1977).\n\n Live at the El Mocambo was produced and engineered by Eddie Kramer, best known for his work with the Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Led Zeppelin. Partly owing to Kramer's input, the album features a somewhat more raw-sounding April Wine than most fans are used to from the band's more conventionally produced studio albums. \n\n\nAmong April Wine's many albums, Live at the El Mocambo has tended to be overshadowed by the more commercially successful Harder, Faster (1979) and The Nature of the Beast (1981). It was released on CD in March, 2010 on Unidisc.\n\nOther artists who have also recorded live albums at the El Mocambo include Elvis Costello, Starz, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Moxy, and Zoobombs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3c3a3e2843187ddfbf036efc669984262e16de","amp;dn":"April+Wine+-+Live+At+The+El+Mocambo+%5B1977%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3c3a3e2843187ddfbf036efc669984262e16de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,60,58,62,40,67,24,125,223,191,3,110,252,102,153,132,38,46,22,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

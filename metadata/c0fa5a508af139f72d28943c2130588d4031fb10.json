He added: &quot;We're not trying to be somebody. If we like something, it's because the music was created by us.&quot; The group consists of: former members of Evanescence - Ben Moody, John LeCompt, Rocky Gray, as well as Carly Smithson and Marty O'Brien.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0fa5a508af139f72d28943c2130588d4031fb10","amp;dn":"We+Are+The+Fallen+-+Tear+The+World+Down+-+2010+ALAC%2C+lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0fa5a508af139f72d28943c2130588d4031fb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,250,90,80,138,241,57,247,45,40,148,60,33,48,88,141,64,49,251,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

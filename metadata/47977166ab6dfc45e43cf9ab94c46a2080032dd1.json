Trademark wit blended with passion intact and with key sideplayers drummer Paul Cook and bassist Clare Kenny helping out among many others -- including a wonderfully scabrous vocal cameo by Mark E. Smith on the very disco &quot;Seventies Night&quot; -- Collins tries all sorts of different things and more often than not comes up with the goods. &quot;The Magic Piper (Of Love)&quot; was the understandable lead single, catchy and with more than a little bite to it, drawing from finger-snapping hep-lounge Vegas sources and his own fun lyrics: &quot;My girlfriend she got blotto/Half cut in Santa's grotto/It turns out he's a dirty old man.&quot; Add to that some just right flute and a clever brass sample that suddenly turns into an orchestrated sample from the Velvet Underground, and the man still has it. It's one of many joys throughout, with Collins showing a musical heterodoxy that would probably stupefy most other bands or acts. &quot;Seventies Night,&quot; for example, is followed up by the sweet orchestration and quick acoustic fingerpicking of &quot;No One Waved Goodbye,&quot; a regretful look at a relationship in pieces. There's full-on feedback and pounding drums, there's sly, compressed production touching quirky keyboards and Euro/cabaret arrangements, and even the self-explanatory Hammond-tinged &quot;Country Rock.&quot; The hint of wistful nostalgia is often matched by the lyrics, with asides like &quot;I'm going back to my old school/Cause to tell you the truth/All those songs of my youth/Move this old fool.&quot; Not many musicians so readily and easily allow for the hints of the passage of time. Leave it to Collins to find a number of ways to do just that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47977166ab6dfc45e43cf9ab94c46a2080032dd1","amp;dn":"Edwyn+Collins+-+I%5C%27m+Not+Following+You+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47977166ab6dfc45e43cf9ab94c46a2080032dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,151,113,102,171,109,252,69,228,60,249,171,148,196,106,32,128,3,45,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

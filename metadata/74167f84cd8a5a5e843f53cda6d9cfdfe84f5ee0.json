He worked with \nDiane Warren (Monica, Brandy, Whitney Houston ETC) Babyface, \nBarry Eastmond (Anita Baker, Barry White), David Foster \n( Chaka Khan), And Jamie Houston ( New comer of soul music \nindustry).\n \nThe songs have good beats, Safe place from the storm is a hot \ntrack with a funky intro a quiet beat and then a Rodney Jerkins \ntype bassline. The Best of Love a Made For Toni Braxton type song. \n\nI think &quot;All That Matters&quot; is at least as good as &quot;Soul Provider&quot; \nand &quot;The One Thing&quot;, if not better, all songs are very pleasant, \nsexy, passionate, catchy in tunes but still very soulful \n(instead of being too &quot;pop&quot;). This album has the edge in that all \nsongs are very consistent, flows naturally from one to another, \nand brings warm romatic mood.\n\nI like especially &quot;safe place from storm&quot;, &quot;best of love&quot;, \n&quot;forevers just a matter of time&quot;, &quot;go the distance&quot;, and \n&quot;heart can be only be so strong&quot;, other songs are also good.\n\nThese are strong, emotional love songs and while they dont express \ndeep and complicated emotions, they are seductive, especially aimed \nfor the gals. \n\nAnd while guys may be less impressed, he Is worth studying in order\nto understand better what reaches his female audience. \n__________\n\n 1.

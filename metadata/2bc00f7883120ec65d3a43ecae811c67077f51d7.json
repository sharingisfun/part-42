In this book, authors provide a comprehensive and motivating overview of this rapidly emerging technology. The book explores how distributed resources can be shared by mobile users in very different ways and for various purposes. The book provides many stimulating examples of resource-sharing applications. Enabling technologies for mobile clouds are also discussed, highlighting the key role of network coding. Mobile clouds have the potential to enhance communications performance, improve utilization of resources and create flexible platforms to share resources in very novel ways","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc00f7883120ec65d3a43ecae811c67077f51d7","amp;dn":"Mobile+Clouds.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc00f7883120ec65d3a43ecae811c67077f51d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,192,15,120,131,18,14,198,93,58,67,236,174,129,28,103,7,127,81,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is a documentary double album featuring interviews, press conferences, and song snippets with voice-overs, and was issued in response to interviews of the Beatles collected on the Vee-Jay Records release, Hear The Beatles Tell All.[citation needed] Originally, Capitol Records intended to release the group's 1964 performance at the Hollywood Bowl, but due to a lack of advanced studio technology and the excessive amount of loud screaming fans on tape the album was shelved. Another plan was to release a 'Greatest Hits' album for the Christmas market. Four songs were to debut on the record: 'A Hard Day's Night', 'Misery', 'There's a Place', and 'From Me to You'. Again, plans were scrapped for release\n\nThe album entered the Billboard Pop Albums on 12 December at number 97, and on 2 January 1965 it reached its peak position at number seven, where it remained for four weeks before beginning its slide down the charts.  It has been certified a gold record by the RIAA; it was also released in Canada and is currently out of print. It was released by Toshiba EMI in Japan on the Apple label (in stereo) in a box set with a deluxe 24 page 12&quot;x12&quot; booklet that contains the entire text of the script in English and Japanese\n\nThe album contains brief stereo excerpts of their 1964 Hollywood Bowl concert, which was unreleased until May 1977 on The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl. Never released in any tape format, The Beatles' Story was being prepared for release on digital audio tape in 1996, but when the format failed commercially the plan was scrapped.  In 2014, The Beatles Story was released on CD for the first time in the Beatles boxed set, The U.S. Albums.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nSTEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;On Stage with the Beatles&quot;   \t1:03\n02. \t&quot;How Beatlemania Began&quot;   \t1:20\n03. \t&quot;Beatlemania in Action&quot;   \t1:25\n04. \t&quot;Man Behind the Beatles Ã¢â‚¬â€ Brian Epstein&quot;   \t2:47\n05. \t&quot;John Lennon&quot;   \t5:50\n06. \t&quot;Who's a Millionaire?&quot;   \t0:39\n07. \t&quot;Beatles Will Be Beatles&quot;   \t7:28\n08. \t&quot;Man Behind the Music Ã¢â‚¬â€ George Martin&quot;   \t1:04\n09. \t&quot;George Harrison&quot;   \t4:46\n10. \t&quot;A Hard Day's Night Ã¢â‚¬â€ Their First Movie&quot;   \t3:08\n11. \t&quot;Paul McCartney&quot;   \t2:45\n12. \t&quot;Sneaky Haircuts and More About Paul&quot;   \t3:29\n13. \t&quot;The Beatles Look at Life&quot;   \t2:05\n14. \t&quot;Victims' of Beatlemania&quot;   \t1:10\n15. \t&quot;Beatle Medley&quot;   \t3:58\n16. \t&quot;Ringo Starr&quot;   \t6:24\n17. \t&quot;Liverpool and All the World!&quot;   \t1:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c72625b718e76f676d05994e7bb7763af2818109","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+The+Beatles%27+Story+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c72625b718e76f676d05994e7bb7763af2818109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,38,37,183,24,231,111,103,109,5,153,78,123,183,118,58,242,129,129,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

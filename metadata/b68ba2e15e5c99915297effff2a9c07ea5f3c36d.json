Yet for all the breadth of its synthesis and sound design, BakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score never loses its musical sensibility or progressive direction. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a stunningly potent and mindblowing piece of music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Randall LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soundtrax)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The music by Darren Baker fuels the suspense, especially during the heart-pounding depiction of the Tarsus ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kubrickian rituals, yet it never intrudes on the documentary aesthetic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Cinemablographer)\n\nCo-inciding with the theatrical releases in France and United Kingdom, and the DVD release in USA, Screamworks Records releases Darren BakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experimental and eclectic score to Christopher MacBrideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chilling thriller, The Conspiracy. Taking you to the dark underbelly of conspiracy theories, this part-mockumentary, part found footage horror film, features music by Canadian composer Darren Baker. Musically, The Conspiracy can be best described as an intelligent mixture of GyÃƒÂ¶rgy Ligeti and the lo-fi industrialist electronica recently popularized by the film scores of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (The Social Network).\n\nScreamworksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ digital release date of September 17 coincides with the most important premiere dates of the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldwide release. The Conspiracy will make its DVD debut in the United States on September 10 (through Anderson Digital) and will be released theatrically in France on September 18 (through Ouranos Films) and in the UK on October 12 (through Arrow Films).\n\nSWD0012 Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ THE CONSPIRACY (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\nMusic Composed by DARREN BAKER\nRelease date (digital): September 17, 2013\n\nTRACK LIST\n\n1 We Are the 1% 4:50\n2 Atlas V 3:20\n3 Steganographia 2:57\n4 To a Million Places (Terrance) 3:10\n5 Vanity and Compacency 2:44\n6 Pattern Refraction 2:06\n7 Three Words: New World Order 1:32\n8 The Cult of Mithras 2:54\n9 Another Truth 4:00\n10 CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est ce quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢elle dit valse 4:56\n11 Occupty Tarsus 1:56\n12 Threnody for Mithras 3:15\n13 Pattern Recognition 1:56\n14 Scherzando 1:10\n15 The Conspiracy 4:10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68ba2e15e5c99915297effff2a9c07ea5f3c36d","amp;dn":"The+Conspiracy+%282012%29+-+Soundtrack+-+Darren+Baker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68ba2e15e5c99915297effff2a9c07ea5f3c36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,139,162,225,94,92,153,145,82,151,239,255,242,169,192,126,165,243,195,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

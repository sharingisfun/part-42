Sinners is the 13th studio album by German power metal band Helloween, released in 2010.\n\nA video clip for &quot;Are You Metal?&quot; was released 11 October 2010. Its visuals draw from the Saw movie franchise and play on clichÃƒÂ©s of the metal genre. The whole album could be heard on Myspace a week before the physical release.\n\nFor the first time since 2000's The Dark Ride, each song on the album is a solo composition, i.e. each member has written both the music and lyrics to his song with no additional input from any other member. 7 Sinners sold 1,900 copies in its first week of release in the U.S.Track listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Where the Sinners Go&quot;   \tDeris \t3:36\n2. \t&quot;Are You Metal?&quot;   \tDeris \t3:35\n3. \t&quot;Who is Mr. Madman?&quot;   \tGerstner \t5:43\n4. \t&quot;Raise the Noise&quot;   \tWeikath \t5:07\n5. \t&quot;World of Fantasy&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t5:15\n6. \t&quot;Long Live the King&quot;   \tDeris \t4:13\n7. \t&quot;The Smile of the Sun&quot;   \tDeris \t4:37\n8. \t&quot;You Stupid Mankind&quot;   \tGerstner \t4:04\n9. \t&quot;If a Mountain Could Talk&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t6:44\n10. \t&quot;The Sage, the Fool, the Sinner&quot;   \tWeikath \t4:00\n11. \t&quot;My Sacrifice&quot;   \tGerstner \t4:59\n12. \t&quot;Not Yet Today&quot;   \tDeris \t1:11\n13. \t&quot;Far in the Future&quot;   \tDeris \t7:42\nDeluxe edition bonus track[2] \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n14. \t&quot;I'm Free&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t4:10\nJapanese bonus tracks[3] \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n14. \t&quot;Faster We Fall&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t4:47\n15. \t&quot;Aiming High&quot;   \tGrosskopf \t4:32\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nBW&amp;BK \t(7.5/10) [4]\nSputnikmusic \t4/5 stars \nAbout.com \t4/5 stars \nSea of Tranquility \t3.5/5 stars \nPersonnel\n\n    Andi Deris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\n    Michael Weikath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Sascha Gerstner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, backing vocals\n    Markus Grosskopf Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\n    Dani LÃƒÂ¶ble Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\nAdditional personnel:\n\n    Matthias Ulmer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keyboards\n    Eddy Wrapiprou Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keyboards\n    Eberhard Hahn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Flute solo on &quot;Raise the Noise&quot;\n    William &quot;Billy&quot; King and Olaf Senkbeil Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Choirs\n    Ron Deris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Additional backing vocals on &quot;Far in the Future&quot;\n    Biff Byford Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Spoken prologue to 'Who is Mr. Madman?'

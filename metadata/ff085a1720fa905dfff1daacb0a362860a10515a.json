The group consists of several young men, and a female leader named Gudrun (after Gudrun Ensslin). All of the characters are named after original members of the Baader-Meinhof Gang or revolutionaries such as Che Guevara.\n\nThey call themselves the &quot;Sixth Generation of the Baader-Meinhof Gang&quot; and &quot;The Raspberry Reich&quot;. &quot;Reich&quot; is a reference to communist sexologist Wilhelm Reich.

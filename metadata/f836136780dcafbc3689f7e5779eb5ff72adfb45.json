Most of these found their way onto Bear Family's 2007 release The Sounds of Our Time, which reissued the full Harlan County album, along with these 45-rpm rarities and unheard demo tapes. As Bear Family was compiling that superb disc, Ford revealed to journalist L-P Anderson that there was a whole bunch of unheard tapes, not sitting in the vault but rather in a canvas bag in his trailer. \n\nSongs here bolster his boast that he could have delivered a hit record if the price were right, but that price was never met, so he left behind gem after gem -- at least it seems that way based on the unreleased tapes Bear Family has dug up, as Point of No Return is every bit as excellent as Sounds. \n\n\nEAC log, cue, m3u &amp; images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f836136780dcafbc3689f7e5779eb5ff72adfb45","amp;dn":"Jim+Ford+Point+Of+No+Return","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f836136780dcafbc3689f7e5779eb5ff72adfb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,54,19,103,128,220,175,188,54,137,247,229,119,158,181,255,114,173,251,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

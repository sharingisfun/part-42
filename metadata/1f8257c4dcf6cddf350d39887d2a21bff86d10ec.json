His memories of the Burma campaign (in which my own father fought) are at times both funny and frightening. Read by the author, they are a must for anybody interested in WW2 or a fan of Flashman's dark humour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8257c4dcf6cddf350d39887d2a21bff86d10ec","amp;dn":"Quartered+Safe+Out+Here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8257c4dcf6cddf350d39887d2a21bff86d10ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,130,87,196,220,246,205,223,53,13,57,136,125,42,33,191,248,109,16,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

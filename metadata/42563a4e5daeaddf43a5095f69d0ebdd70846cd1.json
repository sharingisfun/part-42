Rhodes served as a U.S. Army paratrooper until disabled in a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump and is a former firearms instructor and former member of Rep. Ron PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DC staff. Rhodes will discuss how the NDAA bill attempts to legalize tyranny, as well as Ron Paul's success in New Hampshire. \n\nAlex also talks about the developing situation in Iran where another nuclear scientist was assassinated as the covert war launched by the United States and Israel continues in preparation of a wider and more devastating conflict.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.

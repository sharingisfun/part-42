If you close your eyes, it's as if you're right there. 4 of the tracks are of William Clarke's very last tour prior to his untimely death in 1996. If you're a fan of blues harmonica, this is a must.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ef3f39e0700029ab71502787448888161d78b1","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+William+Clarke+-+Live+Bootleg+Cassette+Anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ef3f39e0700029ab71502787448888161d78b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,239,63,57,224,112,0,41,171,113,80,39,135,68,136,136,22,29,120,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

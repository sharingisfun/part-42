What makes so-called brainwashing so different from the equally insidious effects of indoctrination and conditioning, or even advertising and education?\n\nResearch findings from psychology show that brainwashing is not a special subversive technique; it is the clever manipulation of unrealized influences that operate in all our lives.\n\nThis book, by breaking down so-called brainwashing to its individual elements, shows how social conditioning, need for approval, emotional dependency and much else that we are unaware of, prevent us from being as self-directed as we think; and, conversely, which human traits make us the least susceptible to subtle influence.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nDenise Winn is a British journalist specializing in psychology and medicine. She is a former editor of the UK edition of Psychology Today and has written for national newspapers magazines in Britain for over 20 years. She is author of 11 other books on psychological and medical topics and is currently also editor of The Therapist.\n\nFile Type:\nAdobe pdf\n\nFiles:\nDenise Winn - The Manipulated Mind.pdf\n\nDiscuss This:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://darkdata.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://darkdata.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Knowledge is power&quot; More information at http://DarkData.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0640488a9709d67f8ce0ce134adfa40f3f9f97","amp;dn":"Denise+Winn+-+The+Manipulated+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0640488a9709d67f8ce0ce134adfa40f3f9f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,6,64,72,138,151,9,214,127,140,224,206,19,74,223,164,15,63,159,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

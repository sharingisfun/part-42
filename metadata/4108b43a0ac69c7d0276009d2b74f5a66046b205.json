Its original title was &quot;Dead End Street,&quot; but changed during recording, perhaps to avoid confusion with a 1966 hit of the same title by the Kinks. Some words that survived from that version can be heard in the opening of the third verse, I've been livin' on a dead end street.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½\n\nThe track became the third Top Ten hit from the LP in the UK, peaking at No. 6. As a novelty, initial copies of the 12&quot; and 7&quot; formats were pressed in transparent purple vinyl.\n\nThe version released in the United States was 10 seconds shorter than its British counterpart due to a slightly faster mix. In the U.S., it reached #17 on the Billboard chart in the spring of 1978.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Talkin'_Woman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Talkin'_Woman&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kAbHdaade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kAbHdaade&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video 768x576 25.00fps 2982kbps\n   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo stereo 165kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:40\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

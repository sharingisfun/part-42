Prior to the release of Synergy&amp;#039;s debut Larry Fast had been \nat college. Initially Larry trained as a violinist and pianist before \nentering college and taking a few computer science courses. It was \nduring this period that Larry Fast became interested in synthesized \nmusic and began to build his own synthesizers. At this time he was \nintroduced to Rick Wakeman at a local radio station and both \nmusicians enjoyed an immediate rapport with Larry Fast interesting \nRick Wakeman in his home made instruments and his customizing of \nexisting synthesizers. He was invited over to England to assist with the \nsynthesizers on the Yes album Tales From Topographic Oceans. \nShortly after this Larry Fast gained a record contract, which saw the \nbeginning of Synergy and the subsequent release of the debut album \nwhich received plaudits from no lesser person than Robert Moog \nhimself who at the time claimed the album to be &quot;the most important \nrecording using his Moog synthesizer&quot;. Soon after the release of the \ndebut Synergy album Larry Fast was introduced to Peter Gabriel who \nat the time had just left Genesis to embark on a solo career and Larry \nwas invited by Gabriel to help with the synthesizer work on Peter&amp;#039;s \nseries of self titled solo albums. During this time Larry also worked as \npart of Peter Gabriel&amp;#039;s live band and performed on many sessions for \ndiverse artists including Foreigner, Kate Bush, Art Garfunkel, Hall and \nOates and The Fugees in addition to recording and releasing albums \nwith Synergy. During the eighties Larry Fast also moved into film work \nscoring the films About Last Night and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. \n\nAudion was the fifth album to come from Synergy and was originally \nreleased in 1981. It was the follow up album to Games although this \nalbum has a more rock feel than the structured feel of the previous \nalbum. The album contains ten tracks although again no guitars are \npresent on this recording. Tracks include Orbit Five, Electric Blue and \nAn End To History and with all the albums in this series of re issues \nhas been re mastered and contains sleeve notes by Larry Fast.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a587f58b9eb3de48d790c8a2d9160dd6555f7050","amp;dn":"Synergy+-+Audion+%5B1981%2C+New+Age%5D+2003+reissue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a587f58b9eb3de48d790c8a2d9160dd6555f7050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,135,245,139,158,179,222,72,215,144,200,162,217,22,13,214,85,95,112,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Once these skills are understood, sewists will embrace their dressmaking projects with more confidence and the ability to create chic, refined looks.\nThe DressmakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Handbook of Couture Sewing Techniques unlocks the door to stunning results with better shaping, simpler construction methods, and professional finishing touches. Lynda also explains several seemingly difficult Ã¢â‚¬Å“secrets,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from making bindings and finishing for hems, armholes, and necklines to underpinnings and structuring techniques. Plus, she teaches how to master finishing touches from textured stitches to couching and applique. A complete guide to the fabrics suited to each technique and inspirational fashion photography are also included.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lyndamaynarddesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AboutPortrait-200x300.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lyndamaynarddesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AboutPortrait-200x300.png&lt;/a&gt;\nLynda Maynard has been designing and sewing clothes much of her life.

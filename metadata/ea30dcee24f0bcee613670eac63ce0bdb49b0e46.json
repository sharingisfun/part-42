In fact, a 1999 Locus poll named him the all-time best writer of short fiction as well as the editor of the all-time best anthology (Dangerous Visions). In addition to his dozens of Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards, Ellison has won two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America, and multiple Bram Stoker Awards from the Horror Writers Association (including the Lifetime Achievement Award). As an audiobook narrator, he's twice won Audie Awards and been nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nThe Deathbird &amp; Other Stories presents, for the first time in audio, 13 of EllisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic stories:\n\n&quot;Ellison Wonderland&quot;\n&quot;The Deathbird&quot; (Hugo &amp; Locus winner; Nebula nominee)\n&quot;The Creation of Water&quot;\n&quot;Run for the Stars&quot;\n&quot;Croatoan&quot; (Hugo nominee)\n&quot;The Beast Who Shouted Love at the Heart of the World&quot; (Hugo winner)\n&quot;On the Slab&quot;\n&quot;The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore&quot; (Nebula nominee)\n&quot;The Dreams a Nightmare Dreams&quot;\n&quot;The Whimper of Whipped Dogs&quot;\n&quot;Killing Bernstein&quot;\n&quot;Count the Clock That Tells the Time&quot; (Locus winner; Hugo nominee)\n&quot;How Interesting: A Tiny Man&quot; (Nebula winner)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ellison WonderlandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã‚Â© 1994 by The Kilimanjaro Corporation.

(P)2011 Audible, Inc.\nWhat the Critics Say\n\n&quot;All the narrators are wonderful...However, Ellison as narrator surpasses them all. Once you have heard Ellison read his ownwork, it is impossible to imagine it spoken by anyone else. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not simply that Ellison is a terrific voice actor; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that he inhabits his writing like a hand wears a glove. If you love Ellison, you have to have this. Highly recommended.&quot; (Locus)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea30dcee24f0bcee613670eac63ce0bdb49b0e46","amp;dn":"Audible+Rip+-+Harlan+Ellison+-+The+Deathbird+and+Other+Stories+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea30dcee24f0bcee613670eac63ce0bdb49b0e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,48,220,238,36,240,188,238,97,54,112,234,198,60,224,189,180,155,14,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

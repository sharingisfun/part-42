Joe Hill Louis and Dr. Ross come to mind as greats who plied their trade all by their lonesome -- and so did Juke Boy Bonner, a Texan whose talent never really earned him much in the way of tangible reward. Born into impoverished circumstances in the Lone Star State during the Depression, Weldon Bonner took up the guitar in his teens. He caught a break in 1947 in Houston, winning a talent contest that led to a spot on a local radio outlet. He journeyed to Oakland in 1956, cutting his debut single for Bob Geddins\\' Irma imprint (\\&quot;Rock with Me Baby\\&quot;/\\&quot;Well Baby\\&quot;) with Lafayette \\&quot;Thing\\&quot; Thomas supplying the lead guitar. Goldband Records boss Eddie Shuler was next to take a chance in 1960; Bonner recorded for him in Lake Charles, LA, with Katie Webster on piano, but once again, nothing happened career-wise. Troubled by stomach problems during the \\'60s, Bonner utilized his hospital downtime to write poems that he later turned into songs. He cut his best work during the late \\'60s for Arhoolie Records, accompanying himself on both guitar and racked harmonica as he wove extremely personal tales of his rough life in Houston. A few European tours ensued, but they didn\\'t really lead to much. Toward the end of his life, he toiled in a chicken processing plant to make ends meet. Bonner died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1978.\n\nTracklist\n\n1- Life\\'s Highway\n2- Gimme Some Boone\\'s Farm\n3- Grandmas Will Dog You Around\n4- Carried To The Cleaners And Hung Out To Dry\n5- Nowhere To Run\n6- Dust My Broom\n7- Live My Troubles On Down\n8- Who Was That Awhile Ago\n9- Disappearing Act\n10- The Best Way To Lose The Blues\n11- It\\'s A Shame, Shame, Shame\n12- Loving Arms\n13- Loving Arms\n14- A Distant Feel\n15- What\\'ll I Tell The Children\n16- The Winds Came\n17- Nothing But A Child\n18- Six Over Ten\n\nJuke Boy Bonner Albums:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe One Man Trio  (1967, Flyright LP 3501)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tI\\'m Going Back To The Country, Where They Don\\'t Burn The Buildings Down  (1968, Arhoolie F-1036)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Struggle  (1969, Arhoolie ST 1045, U.S. and Arhoolie AR-19002, Denmark) \no\tRecorded November 30 &amp; December 2, 1968 and May 5, 1969.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThings Ain\\'t Right  (1969, Liberty LBS-83319, UK) \no\tRecorded 1969 in London, England.\no\tJuke Boy Bonner - electric &amp; acoustic guitar, 12 string acoustic guitar, harmonica; John Lewis (Jona Lewie) - piano; The Nighthawkes: Bruce Langsman - guitar; Ron Skinner - bass; Melvyn Wright - drums.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThe Legacy Of The Blues, Vol. 5  (1972, Sonet SNTF-634, Switzerland) \no\tRecorded 1971 in Berkeley, California.

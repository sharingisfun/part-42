Wagner &quot;Death Scene Investigation: A Field Guide&quot;\nCRC | English | November 24, 2008 | ISBN-10: 1420086766 | 237 pages | PDF \n\nEach and every death scene presents new challenges to even the most seasoned investigator. Despite the unique nature of each scenario, using a standardized protocol is the key to ensuring consistent and accurate results. Death Scene Investigation: A Field Guide provides concise direction for the death scene investigator, crime scene investigator, coroner, medical examiner, or anyone associated with the investigation of death.\n\nSince the majority of deaths are due to natural causes, the book emphasizes these situations, yet also examines unnatural circumstances. It begins by providing a general overview of death investigation before delving into a chronological point-by-point analysis of the death scene. Topics discussed include how to assess the body at the scene, and how to investigate natural and unnatural deaths.\n\nExplores Various Causes\nNext, the text demonstrates how death manifests in various parts of the body. A section on traumatic injuries examines and demonstrates with color photographs blunt force, sharp force, and a host of other injuries that the death examiner is likely to confront.\n\nThe book addresses identification methods and explores how to determine signs of resuscitation and previous surgeries. It concludes with a discussion of the purpose and performance of the autopsy and provides a survey of the different forensic experts that may become useful to the death investigator.\n\nEnhanced by numerous color photos, this volume is a direct, succinct handbook that is invaluable to those that confront the reality of death on a day-to-day basis. Its convenient format makes it the perfect guide to take along to the scene.\n\nAbout the Author\nNortheast Indiana Forensic Center, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37bec4acb1b3b13fc129bdc6bf41150a0dce4e07","amp;dn":"Death+Scene+Investigation+-+A+Field+Guide+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37bec4acb1b3b13fc129bdc6bf41150a0dce4e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,190,196,172,177,179,177,63,193,41,189,198,191,65,21,10,13,206,78,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

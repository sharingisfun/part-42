This book provides an innovative reappraisal of the Petrine \nAge, in which hitherto neglected aspects of the tsar's transformation of his \ncountry are studied. More specifically, the reforms enacted by the tsar are \nassessed in light of the religious notion of instauration - a belief in the \nrestoration of Adamic knowledge in the last age - and a historical and cultural \nanalysis of the impact of Western esotericism at the Russian court. This book \nwill appeal to scholars of Russian history and religion, as well as being of \nwider interest to those studying Western esotericism in Early Modern and \neighteenth-century Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:414d578fee0e86e79237bd1ff3aeda216089e026","amp;dn":"Brill+The+Petrine+Instauration+2012+Retail+eBook-kE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"414d578fee0e86e79237bd1ff3aeda216089e026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,77,87,143,238,14,134,231,146,55,189,31,243,174,218,33,96,137,224,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

His mother has just died. His father, a building contractor, can barely keep tabs on his young girlfriend, let alone his own son. Thusly, the teen must navigate his adolescence virtually unsupervised. Floating towards an ill-behaved existence, Howie and his crowd begin robbing houses in the middle-class neighborhoods off the Long Island Expressway. Together, he and his best friend Gary break into a place belonging to an old guy named Big John, a local man who is a respected pillar of the community. When Big John fingers Gary for the crime, Howie learns that his pal has been leading a secret, dangerous but also alluring double life. Subsequently, we also discover that Big John has secrets of his own.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f27aef8cecd7f95eefc29c564332d468e0ae4bb","amp;dn":"L.I.E.+%28AKA+Long+Island+Expressway%29+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f27aef8cecd7f95eefc29c564332d468e0ae4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,39,174,248,206,205,127,149,238,252,41,197,100,51,45,70,142,10,228,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

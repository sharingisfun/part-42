The game was released in both standard and limited edition box sets in Japan on March 14, 2013 for PlayStation Portable. The gameplay has many similarities to MMORPGs, though it is not an online game, including the ability to buy and upgrade weapons, go on missions, and fight in a group with other characters. The game follows an alternate storyline from the end of the first arc of the original story, in which a glitch causes Kirito and the other players to remain in Sword Art Online despite defeating Heathcliff, and players from other VMMORPGs such as Leafa and Sinon get sucked into the game themselves.\n\nThis is the Japanese version and there are no English patches/versions to my knowledge.  There is, however, apparently a translation here:\nTo be used if you need assistance with getting through all of the Japanese.\n\n~I saw a torrent of this PSP iso on here, but it had no seeders, so I found this and decided to put it here.  Never put up a torrent before.\n\n_______________________INSTALL_____________________________________\nAfter downloading, extract using 7zip or Winrar.\nThere are multiple compressed files in the folder.\nExtracting the first one to a target location should automatically extract and compile the others into a single folder.\nSelect the extracted content with the game using a PSP emulator and load it up.\nIt took a little bit to load for me.\nEnjoy\n\n~~NOTE~~\nI share my internet and so I will have a limited upload speed.  No higher than 100kB/s for now, but it may increase in the later hours of the night.  Once this is stable and has other seeders, I will stop seeding.  Be prepared to wait a bit for this to download completely.  I may also be off and on my computer, so the seeding may not be all that reliable.  If it stops for any reason, I ask that you wait before giving up.\n\nOh, and I can't figure out the bayimg thing.  Sorry.

All of these patches work. Just install and reboot Windows. PPPoe configurations are in there as well.There are more registry tweaks available from speedguide.net, but you will need to enter them manually into the registry. Novice users should probably not do these, just stick to the patches, and if you dont know what &quot;regedit&quot; is also do not do anything manual. \n\nAll undo files and default files do just that, return everything back to the way it was. \n\nAnother good setting to optimize in Utorrent is Options/Preferences/Advanced in the windows look for net.max_halfopen....a good setting for this is 100 (note: If you set this to 100 also set EvID4226Patch223d-en to 100) \n\nAll files, documentation, and recommended settings are free and can be found at speedguide.net, cablenut.com, and lvllord.de. \n\nAll files in Windows 9x are for just those OS&amp;#039;s. Same with Windows XP 2000 folder. Cable nut works for most OS&amp;#039;s 98 - XP, same as lvllord. \n\nLvlLord \n\nThis file patches your TCPIP.SYS file and makes you have whatever amount of connections you want to have.....Most users will just use the default settings, but it will ask you if you want to increase or decrease them. Do what you want...I would recommend setting it at 100. \n\nCablenut \n\nHas settings already pre optimized. If you want to put in your own custom settings you can, but you must find latency and other things first. Novice users should just go with what is already there. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cfb3b77c70e1db9e6e025b5b3350ac5b0256e6","amp;dn":"TCP+Optimizer+an+TCPIP.SYS+optimizer+Internet+Booster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cfb3b77c70e1db9e6e025b5b3350ac5b0256e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,207,179,183,124,112,225,219,158,110,2,91,91,51,80,172,91,2,86,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

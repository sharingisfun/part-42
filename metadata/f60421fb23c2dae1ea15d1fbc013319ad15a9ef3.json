Heinlein story turns up. Is it real or counterfeit? It's up to Gerald Knave to scope out the truth. Because it just may be a life-or-death case for him!\n\n&quot;Both Knave and I have more respect and admiration for Robert A. Heinlein than either of us can well say. Nothing said by any person in this report is to be taken as a denigration of Heinlein or his work; indeed, no sf writer mentioned, quoted from, or alluded to by Knave or by any Misfit lacks the respect and admiration we both gladly give him, or her.&quot;--Laurence M.

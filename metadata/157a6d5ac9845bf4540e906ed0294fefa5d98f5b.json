I am open to any constructive critique!\n- I am not the original maker of these keygens and/or scripts.\n- I do not CLAIM to be the original maker of these keygens and/or scripts.\n- I am NOT responsible for the usability or blah blah blah.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSecondly:\n- I hope you find these two programs useful, I have included:\n-- Active@ Hard Disk Monitor Corporate v1.3.95\n-- HDD Life Pro - v3.1.157 (vista-7 64)\n-- HDD Life Pro - v3.1.157 (xp)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThirdly:\n- These are compressed via RAR files. Do not ask how to unzip them as I will already have told you if you read one more sentence!\n\n- Download WinRAR Here: http://rarlabs.com/download.htm (If you don't know what a computer is, download the x86 version to be safe)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFourth:\n- I do not recommend using HDD Life. I downloaded it for initial use for Windows 7 64bit, and could not find a patch that would work. After you patch the program, unless you are running XP, the program would normally just crash. Compatibility options/run as admin, all combinations did not work. I tried!\n\n- I DID however find an old cracked file for HDD Life 2.9.+, so after I installed v3.1.+, I used the patch file for 2.9 and it DID work for 7-64 and XP-32 flawlessly...except it would crash randomly (couple hours of use). This is the ultimate reason I got frustrated and looked for a better program.\n\n- After that mess, I found &quot;Active HDD Monitor Corp ...blah&quot;. The program is tested and DOES work on 7-64 and XP-32. \n\n- The reason I personally recommend this program (Active HDD) is: \n1) Stability!,\n2) You can add networked computers (or even comps online) to your list and view that computers HDDs status alongside your own,\n3) It can e-mail you incase of a critial problem, provided you have an SMTP server, 4) Mainly big thing for me was #2.\n\n- The only thing I did not like about (Active HDD) is:\n1) You cannot configure the tray to show multiple icons for each drive. (Not a big deal)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLastly:\n- I hope you found what you were looking for, I searched for a couple days to come up with this, and although it isn't much, I hope it helps someone out there!\n\n- Take care,\n- Ryan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157a6d5ac9845bf4540e906ed0294fefa5d98f5b","amp;dn":"Hard+Drive+-+Monitoring+Tools+%28HDDLife+%2B+Active+HDD+Monitor+Corp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157a6d5ac9845bf4540e906ed0294fefa5d98f5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,122,109,90,201,132,91,244,84,14,144,110,208,41,79,239,165,217,143,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

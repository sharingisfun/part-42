The album was the idea of producer Derek Lawrence who assembled a group of musicians with whom he had worked in the 1960s. For contractual reasons, the musicians were billed under pseudonyms:\n\n    Albert Lee = Pinta\n    Matthew Fisher = Sorry\n    Ian Paice, of Deep Purple = Speedy\n    Tony Ashton = Bevy\n    Rod Alexander = Vicar\n    Chas Hodges = Sleepy\n    Earl Jordan = Jordan\n    Big Jim Sullivan = Boss\n    Ritchie Blackmore, of Deep Purple = Boots\n\nDespite rumours at the time Jeff Beck, Roger Glover and Jon Lord do not appear on the sessions. A few originals (penned by Lawrence) were played, as well as many blues-inflected covers of rock songs. The guitar workout song &quot;Bullfrog&quot; is basically Deep Purple's song &quot;Jam Stew&quot; which Purple had originally performed for the BBC Studio Sessions. A record of this session was released in 1972 by Decca in the U.S, as well as a single coupling the tracks My Baby Left Me and Lovin' You Is Good For Me, Baby (Decca 32831.) As a long playing it was first issued on vinyl by MCA Records in the U.K. and Decca records in the U.S.\n\nA reissue was released in 1980 under ECY Street Records on Vinyl in the US.\n\nFour tracks recorded by Green Bullfrog have been published on the Ritchie Blackmore compilation Get Away - Groups and Sessions (2005).\n\nIt was remixed at Abbey Road Studios, London in 1991 by Derek Lawrence and released on CD.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Ain't Nobody Home&quot; (Jerry Ragovoy)\n    &quot;Bullfrog&quot; (Derek Lawrence, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice) \n    &quot;Walk a Mile in My Shoes&quot; (Joe South) \n    &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot; (Arthur Crudup) \n    &quot;Makin' Time&quot; (Eddie Phillips, Kenny Pickett) \n    &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; (Lloyd Price) \n    &quot;I'm a Free Man&quot; (Mark &quot;Moogy&quot; Klingman) \n    &quot;Lovin' You is Good for Me Baby&quot; (Lawrence/Corlett/Hutton) \n    &quot;I Want You&quot; (Tony Joe White) \n    &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; (Doug Kershaw)\n    &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; (Ellas McDaniel)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a2b80295a7c0350c4ec15d7fd30feb527c0d45","amp;dn":"Green+Bullfrog+-+Green+Bullfrog+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a2b80295a7c0350c4ec15d7fd30feb527c0d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,162,184,2,149,167,192,53,12,78,193,93,127,211,15,235,82,124,13,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

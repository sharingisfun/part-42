In teaching introductory environmental and physical geology courses, the authors found that topics involving natural hazards are among the most interesting for students. They also realized that employing natural hazards as a thematic focus and context motivates students to learn basic scientific concepts. Students begin each chapter by reading about the underlying geological processes as well as the key terms that describe them. Next, they explore the impact these processes have on humans (as well as the impact that humans have on the processes). Finally, the authors analyze strategies for mitigating these hazards' physical and financial harm, and present prospects for the future.Kindle textbooks are functionally equivalent to the print textbook. In some cases, individual items such as ancillary images or multimedia have been removed for digital delivery due to rights restrictions.\nAbout the Author\nDonald Hyndman is a recently retired Professor in the Department of Geology at the University of Montana, where he has taught courses in natural hazards, regional geology, igneous and metamorphic petrology, volcanology, and advanced igneous petrology. He continues to teach courses in natural hazards. Donald is co-originator and coauthor of six books in the Roadside Geology series and one on the geology of the Pacific Northwest, and is also the author of a textbook on Igneous Petrology. His B.S. in Geological Engineering is from the University of British Columbia and his Ph.D. in Geology is from the University of California, Berkeley. He has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and the Distinguished Scholar Award, both given by the University of Montana.\n\nDavid Hyndman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at Michigan State University, where he teaches courses in natural hazards, environmental geology, physical geology, and advanced hydrogeology. His B.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources is from the University of Arizona and his M.S. in Applied Earth Sciences and Ph.D. in Geological and Environmental Sciences are from Stanford University. David is an Associate Editor for the journals &quot;Water Resources Research&quot; and &quot;Ground Water,&quot; has been selected for the Ronald Wilson Teaching Award, and has been the 2002 Darcy Distinguished Lecturer as well as a Lilly Teaching Fellow.\nProduct Details\n\n  \n \n    * Print Length: 592 pages\n    * Publisher: Brooks/Cole; 3 edition (August 25, 2010)\n   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff30cc69da8fb0e8874702ab55b2ea1bdada5d76","amp;dn":"Natural+Hazards+and+Disasters+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff30cc69da8fb0e8874702ab55b2ea1bdada5d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,48,204,105,218,143,176,232,135,71,2,171,85,178,234,27,218,218,93,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

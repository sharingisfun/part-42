The book takes\ninspiration from a vividly eccentric, and radical,\nself-help group for stage frightened performers\nin 1940s Manhattan, which coincided with the\nterrifying height of World War II and was called\nThe Society of Timid Souls. Seventy years later,\nas anxiety about everything from terrorism to\neconomic meltdown continues, Morland argues that\ncourage has become a virtue in crisis. We are,\nshe says, all Timid Souls now.\n\nThe Society of Timid Souls: or, How To Be Brave\nBy: Polly Morland\nISBN13: 9780307889089\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 573","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca723c05c8752e8203161063f33de92c588a461","amp;dn":"The+Society+of+Timid+Souls+or%2C+How+To+Be+Brave+by+Polly+Morland.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca723c05c8752e8203161063f33de92c588a461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,167,35,192,92,135,82,232,32,49,97,6,63,51,222,146,197,136,164,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been holding off uploading this one in the hopes that I could find the TPB version, which contained an extra 100 pages and finished the story. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not finding it, though, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to go ahead and set this one free in hopes somebody else might have a scan of that book, or a hard copy of the book they can scan. If not, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get around to purchasing it eventually, because I want to read the rest of the story.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssues 1-4 of 'Elk's Run'\nHoarse and Buggy Productions, 2005-2007, 28-32 pages\nWritten by Joshua Hale Fialkov\nPenciled and Inked by Noel Tuazon\nColored by Scott A Keating\n\nThe town of Elk's Ridge, West Virginia, was built on a dream: The dream of war-scarred Vietnam veterans to live in peace and harmony, in a place untouched by violence, crime, corruption, or greed. A living Norman Rockwell painting, governed by the most basic values and free of all things considered undesirable by its founders. It was supposed to be paradise. And for a while, it was.\n\nOver the years, some in Elk's Ridge have grown restless. They fear their refuge has become a prison...or a tomb. And they yearn to do the forbidden: escape. But when one desperate bid for freedom ends in a tragic accident, a heinous act of mob justice suddenly tears the idyllic mask from this promised land and the evil its residents sought to keep out blooms from within. \n\nA chillingly lyrical tale, rendered in starkly beautiful, visceral artwork, Elk's Run is unforgettable and unrelentingly powerful.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6805e85e18e7aca46d488e550e624f4a115796e6","amp;dn":"Elk%27s+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6805e85e18e7aca46d488e550e624f4a115796e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,5,232,94,24,231,172,164,109,72,142,85,14,98,79,74,17,87,150,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

What started as a joke in the A State of Trance radio show, has now turned into a worldwide happening: &quot;Who's Afraid of 138?!&quot;. And so, Armin van Buuren decided to dedicate an entire record label to the booming bass of uplifting. And it kicks off with his very own &quot;Who's Afraid of 138?!&quot;, in the smashing Photographer remix.\n A realm for the 138 BPM junkies, a welcome home to those who create or support it. The label of &quot;Who's Afraid of 138?!&quot; kicks off with the much-wanted Photographer remix of Armin's &quot;Who's Afraid of 138?!&quot; track, taken from his &quot;Intense&quot; album.\n Often played in his ASOT shows and loved by many, it has become the soundtrack to a new sensation, hitting dance land at a swift pace.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89af7be07b57ed0582576a96bcc47c5a8f89947b","amp;dn":"Armin+van+Buuren+-+Who%27s+Afraid+Of+138%3F%21+%282013%29+FLAC+%5BWAO138001%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89af7be07b57ed0582576a96bcc47c5a8f89947b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,175,123,224,123,87,237,5,130,87,106,150,188,196,124,90,143,137,148,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

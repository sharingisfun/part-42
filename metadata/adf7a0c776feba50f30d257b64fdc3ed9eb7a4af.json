This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nSUBTITLES: external, English, English for hearing impaired.\n\nWARNING: If you limit your upload speed during the download in initial seeding phase (when I am single seeder) FOR WHATEVER REASON, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be kicked-out for good. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be later, I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care less, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to your consciousness in relation to other people. Any ratio below 1.084 for sure means death of P2P, torrents and whole idea of sharing.\n\nI am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m some kind of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfree launchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ downloading service. NO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \nAlso, in the future, if I spot something like kind of gang-banging of innocents, you'll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things I've just said, please - go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And don't come back. Please.\n\nMany people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between &quot;normal&quot; swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say &quot;OK, 0/1 seeder&quot;; but infact, they do not recognize all implications of joining to initial-seeding swarm. To keep it short and simple, if anyone need/wants to save on traffic - for whatever reason - better is to stay away and wait till more than four stable seeders are present. Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio - all other &quot;types of behaviour&quot; leads to semi-catastrophic consequences, not only to individual peer, but to ALL peers in specific swarm.\nWhy is that, I've explained numerous times on name-not-to-be-spoken - and I might post this Q&amp;A part of the text here. Maybe.\n\nIMPORTANT: Torrents, especially of UK shows, are under constant and coordinated attack from British-based IP numbers. If you see number of peers with very, very similar address block them all (block range) with your firewall.\nTheir MO is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbyte-thrashersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; they aggressively pull bytes from normal peers, causing other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ peers to tag you as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncooperativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ since all newer torrent programs have built-in Friend or Foe mechanism. \nNormal clients receive nothing from you (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cause you gave packets to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgremlinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you back any byte ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ simple as that. \nCompanies currently pay agencies and individuals to starve us to death (byte-wise and otherwise). Do not let them to get richer, and let us just to wave to their Jags, Porschs and yachts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adf7a0c776feba50f30d257b64fdc3ed9eb7a4af","amp;dn":"Being.Human.S02E05.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adf7a0c776feba50f30d257b64fdc3ed9eb7a4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,247,160,199,118,254,186,80,243,13,37,123,100,253,195,237,158,183,164,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Most of us take the monetary system for granted, but it has a profound and largely misunderstood influence on our lives.  THE MONEY FIX is a feature-length documentary exploring our societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship with the almighty dollar.  \n\nTHE MONEY FIX examines economic patterning in both the human and the natural worlds, and through this lens we learn how we can empower ourselves by redesigning the lifeblood of the economy at the community level. The film documents three types of alternative money systems, all of which help solve economic problems for the communities in which they operate.\n\nThis website is dedicated to providing you with resources to educate yourself about currency.  We hope you will find space in your busy life to ponder deeply what kinds of economic relationships you wish to be in.  Conventional money is just one way to measure wealth.  How will you measure the wealth you create?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7f58db9589a78534b11154620829aae3d25b84","amp;dn":"The+Money+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7f58db9589a78534b11154620829aae3d25b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,127,88,219,149,137,167,133,52,177,17,84,98,8,41,170,227,210,91,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

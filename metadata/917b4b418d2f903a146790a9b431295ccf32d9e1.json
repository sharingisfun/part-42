The midsize group will recall his influence on the Birth of the Cool sessions. Rather than the uniform instruments of the conventional big band, Evans picked his instruments individually for what they could contribute to distinctive tone colors. Thus the band includes a French horn in the brass and a reed section of soprano and alto saxophones and bassoon. The result is a series of highly distinct textures and a clarity that illuminates each piece. Evans&amp;#039;s inventiveness extended to applying his gift for complex harmonies to Leadbelly&amp;#039;s &quot;Ella Speed,&quot; a sign of the openness that would later lead him to the music of Jimi Hendrix. The excellent soloists here include Evans&amp;#039;s longtime associate John Carisi on trumpet, Lee Konitz on alto, and a young Steve Lacy on soprano. \n\nPersonnel:  \t\nGil Evans - piano\nWillie Ruff - French horn\nBart Varsalona - bass trombone\nDave Kurtzer - bassoon\nJake Koven - trumpet\n\nRecorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, New Jersey on September 6 &amp; 27 and October 10, 1957.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Remember 4:30\n2.Ella Speed 5:47\n3.Big Stuff 4:46\n4.Nobody&amp;#039;s Heart 4:22\n5.Just One Of Those Things 4:23\n6.If You Could See Me Now 4:15\n7.Jambangle 4:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:917b4b418d2f903a146790a9b431295ccf32d9e1","amp;dn":"Gil+Evan+-+Gil+Evans+%26+Ten+%28Impulse%21%2C+1957%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"917b4b418d2f903a146790a9b431295ccf32d9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,123,75,65,141,47,144,58,20,103,144,169,180,49,41,92,207,50,217,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

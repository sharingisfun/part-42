A Patron, he has everything a boy could possibly wantâ€”the latest tech, the coolest clothes, and a Proxy to take all his punishments. When Knox breaks a vase, Syd is beaten. When Knox plays a practical joke, Syd is forced to haul rocks. And when Knox crashes a car, killing one of his friends, Syd is branded and sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nSyd is a Proxy. His life is not his own.\r\n\r\nThen again, neither is Knoxâ€™s. Knox and Syd have more in common than either would guess. So when Knox and Syd realize that the only way to beat the system is to save each other, they flee. Yet Knoxâ€™s father is no ordinary Patron, and Syd is no ordinary Proxy. The ensuing cross-country chase will uncover a secret society of rebels, test both boysâ€™ resolve, and shine a blinding light onto a world of those who owe and those who pay. Some debts, it turns out, cannot be repaid. \r\n\r\n\r\n         --------------------      GUARDIAN    -----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe pulse-pounding sequel to Proxy! Inspired by The Whipping Boy and Feed, this adrenaline-fueled thriller will appeal to fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent.\r\n\r\nIn the new world led by the Rebooters, former Proxy Syd is the figurehead of the Revolution, beloved by some and hated by others. Liam, a seventeen-year-old Rebooter, is Sydâ€™s bodyguard and must protect him with his life. But armed Machinists arenâ€™t the only danger.\r\n\r\nPeople are falling illâ€”their veins show through their skin, they find it hard to speak, and sores erupt all over their bodies. Guardians, the violent enforcers of the old system, are hit first, and the government does nothing to help. The old elites fall next, and in the face of an indifferent government, Syd decides itâ€™s up to him to find a cure . . . and what he discovers leaves him stunned.\r\n\r\nThis heart-stopping thriller is packed with action, adventure, and heroics. Guardian will leave you breathless until the final page.\r\n\r\nA fast-paced, thrill-ride of novel full of non-stop action, heart-hammering suspense and true friendshipâ€”just as moving as it is exhilarating. Fans of Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, James Dashner's Maze Runner, Patrick Ness's Chaos Walking series, and Marie Lu's Legend trilogy will be swept away by this story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9004b93574fae7b7f828815e33b0d27302d8ec01","amp;dn":"Proxy+Series+-+Alex+London","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9004b93574fae7b7f828815e33b0d27302d8ec01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,4,185,53,116,250,231,183,248,40,129,94,51,176,210,115,2,216,236,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

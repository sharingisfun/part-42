As campaign advisor to London mayoral candidate Thom Conran, he can always escape the pressures of the political arena and London city life to his country retreat. But when his errant daughter, whose fifteenth birthday is imminent, becomes embroiled in the politics of change that is sweeping the nation, when the problems show up literally right in his own backyard, Max's true colors begin to surface as he becomes torn between his current political allegiances and his more radical past. And all the while, the madding crowd is getting closer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5eb0c2b62e48348c86d326c19d9aff15c9cc255","amp;dn":"The+Birthday+Riots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5eb0c2b62e48348c86d326c19d9aff15c9cc255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,235,12,43,98,228,131,72,200,109,50,108,25,217,175,241,92,156,194,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

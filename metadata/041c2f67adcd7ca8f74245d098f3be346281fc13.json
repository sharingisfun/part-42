He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. Plato&amp;#039;s example of the cave was probably the first inquiry ever into the possible effects of television, the illusion of reality, on the minds of man.\n\n&quot;I don&amp;#039;t know anything that gives me greater pleasure, or profit either, than talking or listening to philosophy. But when it comes to ordinary conversation, such as the stuff you talk about financiers and the money market, well, I find it pretty tiresome personally, and I feel sorry that my friends should think they&amp;#039;re being very busy when they&amp;#039;re really doing absolutely nothing. Of course, I know your idea of me: you think I&amp;#039;m just a poor unfortunate, and I shouldn&amp;#039;t wonder if your right. But then I dont THINK that you&amp;#039;re unfortunate - I know you are.&quot; -- Plato\n\n\n\nIncludes:\n\n- 4 short videos\n- Most (all?) of Plato&amp;#039;s works (Text)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041c2f67adcd7ca8f74245d098f3be346281fc13","amp;dn":"Plato+-+One+of+the+Greatest+Teacher+in+History+%28Philosophy%2CMetap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041c2f67adcd7ca8f74245d098f3be346281fc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,28,47,103,173,205,124,168,247,66,69,208,152,243,190,52,98,129,252,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

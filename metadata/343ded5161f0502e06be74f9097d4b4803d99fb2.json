Iz dnevnikov voyny. Povestvovanie v pyati chastyakh AKA Spiritual Voices (1995)\n\nRussian with English, French, Spanish, German, Italian subs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112911&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112911&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007LFPKW.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007LFPKW.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe film develops as the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diary, where unbiased narration is dissolved in the lyrical intonation. You watch the real persons in the particular circumstances on the screen. They are Russian frontierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“guards on the TadjikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Afghani border. But it is also a piece of art, where aesthetic laws give the theme and arrange the facts taken from life.\n\nThat is why the film begins with the story about Mozart, about death concealing under the poor cover of the daily routine, about music, breaking through this cover and absorbing spiritual voices of the Universe. And that's why the northern landscape is being shown during a long while, motionless and at the same time subtly changing.\n\nThe border between life, which is far away, and death, which is always close, this is the environment of the people in the war. That's why they attract authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and ours as well. Sometimes the filmmaker identifies himself with these people. Sokurov grew up in the family of a military officer and he understands the boyish curiosity for the warfare, in which youths must be engaged. He follows the people in the soldiersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ boots, and we, spectators, follow him; but suddenly he separates himself from his personages, he looks at them tenderly, he is puzzled, he suffers and prays.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/3913/spvo013hj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/3913/spvo013hj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img175.echo.cx/img175/156/spvo027wp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img175.echo.cx/img175/156/spvo027wp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img175.echo.cx/img175/7313/spvo032cc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img175.echo.cx/img175/7313/spvo032cc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7802/spvo043ek.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7802/spvo043ek.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip---------\n\n~~~~~~ Dukhovnye golosa.Part 1.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................323,192,832                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................DivX 5.2.0              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................37:53.194                \nFrame Count:....................................68127             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................576                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................29.970          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1003                 \n......MPEG-4..............................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.134&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................120                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.

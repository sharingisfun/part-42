Finance! Bleeping Bankers!\n\nMax Keiser and co-host, Stacy Herbert look at one Irishman in America speaking his mind about Irish bleeping bankers and while another Irishman, David Drumm, an Irish bleeping banker, is on the run and declaring bankruptcy in Massachusetts after bankrupting his own nation. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Ed Harrison about the European financial crisis.\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.\n\nI am including the video in the torrent this time, but if you would rather not download that file, you can watch the video online at:\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n \n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement \n of the contents. \n\n Think for yourself!

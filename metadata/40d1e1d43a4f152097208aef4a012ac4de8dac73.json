Stunned at how basic the production is, Vera attempts to back out, but is convinced by some of the locals to give their town a chance.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, the warmth and charm of the small town grows on Vera and she even enjoys the experience of directing the pageant. When Vera discovers her former fiancÃ© Jack (Robert Mailhouse) recommended her for the job, she is outraged. But over time Vera appreciates the gesture, as she grows close to both Jack and his young daughter (Lennon Wynn). Will love stay in the wings this time around?\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 11-Dec-2011\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                             : 1\r\nFormat                         : HEVC\r\nFormat/Info                    : High Efficiency Video Coding\r\nFormat profile                 :   \r\nCodec ID                       : V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC\r\nWidth                          : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight                         : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                : Variable\r\nOriginal frame rate            : 23.976 fps\r\nColor space                    : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\r\nDURATION                       : 01:23:20.267000000\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                             : 2\r\nFormat                         : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                 : LC\r\nCodec ID                       : A_AAC\r\nDuration                       : 1h 23mn\r\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode               : Lossy\r\nWriting library                : Lavc56.60.100 aac\r\nLanguage                       : English\r\nDefault                        : Yes\r\nForced                         : No\r\nDURATION                       : 01:23:20.277000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d1e1d43a4f152097208aef4a012ac4de8dac73","amp;dn":"The+Christmas+Pageant+2011+Hallmark+720p.HDTV.HEVC.x265-RMTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d1e1d43a4f152097208aef4a012ac4de8dac73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,209,225,212,58,79,21,32,151,32,138,239,74,1,42,196,222,141,172,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

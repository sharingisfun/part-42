It begins with a look at the creative arts in ancient Africa, and then traces the development of filmmaking, music, writing, and the visual arts from their beginnings here in America to the present time. Excellent-quality fine-art reproductions appear throughout. What sets this book apart, however, is the scope and variety of the full-color and black-and-white archival photographs. Black pioneers in various fields are singled out and accorded the recognition they deserve; artists working today are given recognition also, but in such a way as to show the debt they owe to those who went before them and who frequently paid a heavy price for being black and creative. This treatment makes the subject accessible to a wide range of readers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8469571c4b70c6150c2abcfae5cb2dfec8547957","amp;dn":"African+Americans%2C+Voices+of+triumph-Creative+Fire+%28Time+Life%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8469571c4b70c6150c2abcfae5cb2dfec8547957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,105,87,28,75,112,198,21,12,42,188,250,229,203,45,254,200,84,121,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

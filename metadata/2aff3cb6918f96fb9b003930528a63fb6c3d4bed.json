While this type of music has been done \nad-nauseum over the years, BBR do it well and it sounds better than most.\n\nAt times vocalist Jan Paternoster sounds uncannily like Mick Jagger with an incredibly raw, sex-driven energy and delivery that is reminiscent of early era glam bands. As you might imagine, with only two musicians the album\\'s production is stripped down and simple. While there may be no bells and whistles herein, this is no way does detracts from the big picture. Raw and rough around the edges, My Perception really stands on its own. Bottom line this is a really enjoyable rock nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll record!\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Madhouse\n02.

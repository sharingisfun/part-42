Proceed with caution...\n\nGuests: Steven Crowder, Jim Norton\n\nEpisode 197 &quot;Walking on Antshells&quot;: Rocking the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paulie WalnutsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ once again, Anthony talks about last nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roast of Big Jay, the shooting news out of Chattanooga, the callers weigh in with their thoughts, and we hear parts of AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set from last night as he defends bombing accusations. Steven Crowder joins via Skype to talk about stand-up comedy, language policing differing in America and Canada, freedom of expression, the hypocrisy of tolerance, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“courageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner versus other sports stars, getting bullied for comments, comparing tragedies, walking the line of mean and funny, and Ann Coulter. Ant takes it back to the phones where Jim Norton calls to joke about being cut from Trainwreck, they critique AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance on Big JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roast, talk about writing roast material, Chip brags about his roasting skills, and they briefly talk about the new studio as well as the shooting in Chattanooga. After Ant rants about what bombing means, we see a video of the new studio, he chats with the callers once again about the roast, talks about the upcoming live show from Comic-Con in Tampa, William Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Shatner, Major Garrett versus Obama, a Princess Leia doll causing debate, and Marilyn MosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shitty family. Our psychic friend Ant then shows us a video of a shooting drone, one of a dumb ass robber, plays the video of Big Jay handling that asshole heckler, he once again hears it about his roast appearance, gets some last digs in on poor little Joe DeRosa, and we watch Caitlyn Jenner accepting an award at the ESPYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc18a0388c7ce6e6352879f2536ce0632e5dde54","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-07-16+Steven+Crowder+Jim+Norton+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc18a0388c7ce6e6352879f2536ce0632e5dde54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,24,160,56,140,124,230,230,53,40,121,242,83,108,224,99,46,93,222,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The Asbury Jukes horn section and jazz trumpet legend Randy Brecker made this a great night for brass lovers.\n\nGregg came out roaring in the first set, sounding great on the opening combo of &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot; and &quot;Midnight Rider.&quot;  A slinky, soulful &quot;Who's Been Talking&quot; was a strong performance, and &quot;Sailin' 'Cross The Devil's Sea&quot; continued its revival.  After the Eastern flavor of &quot;Egypt&quot; and the deep blues of &quot;The Sky Is Crying,&quot; the Asbury Jukes horns came out for powerful versions of &quot;Stand Back&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City&quot; to close the first set.\n\nThe first part of the second set was a jazz odyssey of epic proportions in a run that has taken on a jazzy flavor.  Trumpet master Randy Brecker sounded great on &quot;Spanish Key,&quot; &quot;Desdemona&quot; and &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,&quot; and the band matched him step for step.\n\nThe Juke Horns then returned for a couple of soulful, bluesy tunes that were perfectly accented by a big brass section.  &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; always sounds better with horns, and this version of &quot;Into The Mystic&quot; really soars.  &quot;Leave My Blues At Home&gt;JaMaBuBu&gt;You Don't Love Me&quot; ended the set on a rocking note, and then the Juke Horns and Brecker all joined in on a big band-style &quot;Southbound&quot; encore you've got to hear to believe!\n\nDisc One\n\n1.

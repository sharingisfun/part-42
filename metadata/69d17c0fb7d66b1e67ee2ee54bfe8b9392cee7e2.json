Within a generation, more households will be supported by women than by men. In The Richer Sex, Liza Mundy takes us to the exciting frontier of this new economic order: she shows us why this flip is inevitable, what painful adjustments will have to be made along the way, and how both men and women will feel surprisingly liberated in the end.\n\n     The bestselling author and Washington Post writer goes deep inside the lives of the couples on this cutting edge to paint of picture of how dating, marriage, and home life are changing. How does this new generation of breadwomen navigate paying for a night on the town? In whose interest is it to delay commitment? Are men for the first time thinking of marriage the way women used toÃ¢â‚¬â€as a bet on the economic potential of a spouse? In this new world of men marrying up,  are women learning to value new realms of male endeavorÃ¢â‚¬â€like parenting, protection, and a margarita at the ready?\n\n     The future is here, with couples today debating who must assume the responsibility of primary earner and who gets the freedom of being the slow track partner. With more men choosing to stay home, Mundy shows how that lifestyle has achieved a higher status and all the ways males have found to recover their masculinity. And the revolution is global: Mundy takes us from Japan to Denmark to show how both sexes are adapting as the marriage market has turned into a giant free-for-all, with men and women at different stages of this transformation finding partners in other countries who match their expectations.\n\n     The Richer Sex is a wild ride into the future, grounded in MundyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peerless journalism, and bound to cause women and men of all generations to rethink what this social upheaval will mean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d17c0fb7d66b1e67ee2ee54bfe8b9392cee7e2","amp;dn":"The+Richer+Sex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d17c0fb7d66b1e67ee2ee54bfe8b9392cee7e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,209,124,15,183,214,107,30,103,238,46,229,75,254,139,147,146,206,231,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

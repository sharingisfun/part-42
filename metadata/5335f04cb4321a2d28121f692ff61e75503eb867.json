Perhaps the most important thing nobody mentions on this DVD is the tremendous competitive advantage he gets from his Australian Size 17 feet! (That means REALLY HUGE! and off any size chart or size converter system which go up to maybe 12 or 13 -- 15 max!)\n\nYoungest ever individual male world champion swimmer at 14, making him the fastest 14-year-old male swimmer in history.\n\nFirst ever winner of 6 six gold medals in one world championship.\n\n5 Olympic gold medals -- most won by any Australian.\n\n11 World Championship golds.\n\n13 individual long-course world records.\n\nYoung Australian of the Year in 2000.\n\n4 Commonwealth Games gold medals.\n\nWorld record setter for 200 m &amp; 400 m freestyle.\n\nQuit swimming in 2006 because of &quot;waning motivation&quot; -- about the same time Brazilian swimmer Daniel Mendes became his housemate. They started out as &quot;training partners&quot; before becoming &quot;friends.&quot; Thorpe's manager says they're &quot;just mates&quot;. (Ask an Aussie to translate that for you.)\n\nIan was a great swimmer but this DVD comes close to being a puff piece about what a nice guy he is &quot;and so great with children&quot; but there is some good training material as well.\n\nAny DVD Converter split this into more than a dozen files. Combining them into one file with WinAVI would cause a substantial loss in quality so I've kept the files separate and put most of them (not all) in a folder zipped with WinRAR. Nothing else was added to the folder, no ads, no links, no promo, no nothin -- just Ian Thorpe.\n\nChapters of the DVD include:\n\nProfile\n  Career highlight\n  Achievments\n  Statistics\n  Photo library\n\nFreestyle\n  Warm up\n  The stroke\n  The start\n  The turn\n  Strength training\n  Swimming for life\n\nPoolside\n  My inspiration\n  Goal setting\n  Achieving success\n  Eating for success\n  Drug use in sport\n\nBeneath the suit\n  Fashion\n  Music\n  Travel\n  Fountain for youth\n\nXtras\n  The making\n  DVD-Rom\n\nI left out stuff I didn't like but kept the cool &quot;Matrix&quot; style special camera effects showing his dive as well as his training tips. You get more freedom to select what to watch this way.\n\nIn ian_thorpe.rar You get:\n\nachieving_success.avi    20,215 KB\ncareer_highlights.avi    32,319 KB\ndrug_use_in_sport.avi    19,458 KB\neating_for_success.avi   10,724 KB\ngoal_setting.avi         29,296 KB\nmy_inspiration.avi       12,143 KB\nphoto_library.avi        5,064 KB\nstrength_training.avi    31,723 KB\nswimming_for_life.avi    29,133 KB\nthe_making.avi           94,428 KB\nthe_start.avi            13,364 KB\nthe_stroke.avi           36,953 KB\nthe_turn.avi             10,035 KB\ntravel.avi               36,616 KB\nwarm_up.avi              8,633 KB\n\nIf you want everything on the DVD because you really love Ian Thorpe then BUY the DVD and get the top quality and complete work and maybe it'll put a few bucks in the swimmer's pocket.\n\nYou will note a clear difference between his demonstrated practice stroke and his stroke during an actual competition.\n\nThe video quality of the DVD is excellent and the menus are clever and beautiful. The audio is really great.\n\nOur swimming torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061036/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_for_iPod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061036/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_for_iPod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061140/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_MPG_PAL_DVD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061140/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_MPG_PAL_DVD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745018/Total_Immersion_Freestyle_Made_Easy.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745018/Total_Immersion_Freestyle_Made_Easy.avi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745155/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Freestyle_Made_Easy_DVD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745155/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Freestyle_Made_Easy_DVD&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4833280/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Four_Stokes_Made_Easy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4833280/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Four_Stokes_Made_Easy&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832735/Swim_Fast__Michael_Phelps___Butterfly__Flying_Less&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832735/Swim_Fast__Michael_Phelps___Butterfly__Flying_Less&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832562/Swim_Fast__Lindsay_Benko_s_Freestyle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832562/Swim_Fast__Lindsay_Benko_s_Freestyle&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4834962/Swim_Fast__Series_-_Breastroke_According_to_Moses_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4834962/Swim_Fast__Series_-_Breastroke_According_to_Moses_&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n---------------------------\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Thorpe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5335f04cb4321a2d28121f692ff61e75503eb867","amp;dn":"Ian+Thorpe+-+Beneath+the+Suit%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5335f04cb4321a2d28121f692ff61e75503eb867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,53,240,76,180,50,26,45,40,18,31,105,47,246,30,117,80,62,184,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

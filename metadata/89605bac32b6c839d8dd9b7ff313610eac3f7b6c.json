Dog Named Summer\n\nThe Northeastern U.S. went through an indie folk revival at the turn of the millennium, and Providence, RI, fostered an interesting scene, from which Fern Knight may be the most lovable and challenging. Lovable because Margie Wienk's voice has an unaffected charm that immediately gets to you and her songs don't need to rely on oblique mythology or dark fairy tales, her everyday surreal having more poetic impact. Challenging because you never know when a simple three-minute song will launch into an extended sonic exploration. The latter will be an aggravating trait to some listeners, and indeed, at times it feels like a clever way to fill up the album, but after a few listens fondness grows (especially the four-minute instrumental coda of &quot;Boxing Day&quot;). Instrumental tracks mainly consist of processed electric guitar, mallet percussion, and Fender Rhodes. The songs rely on a more acoustic palette, such as acoustic guitar, violin, and cello, all provided by Wienk and Mike Corcoran, who also engineered the recordings. Alec K. Redfearn contributes accordion to two pieces. &quot;If I Could Write a Book About You&quot; and &quot;Wolf II&quot; are the best songs; they pair nicely chiselled melodies with creative arrangements and mischievously honest lyrics. Seven Years of Severed Limbs is seductive, addictive, and a wonderful new-folk find from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89605bac32b6c839d8dd9b7ff313610eac3f7b6c","amp;dn":"Fern+Knight+-+Seven+Years+of+Severed+Limbs+%5B2004%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89605bac32b6c839d8dd9b7ff313610eac3f7b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,96,91,172,50,182,200,57,216,221,155,127,243,19,97,14,172,63,123,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

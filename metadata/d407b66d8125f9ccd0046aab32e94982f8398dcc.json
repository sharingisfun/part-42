But as proven by the double-disc set, Studio Sessions, this assumption is false. Compiled from tapes from the group's keyboardist, Mark Stanway, Grand Slam saw Lynott attempting to update Thin Lizzy's guitar-driven hard rockin' style, with more of an emphasis on keyboards/electronics and pop melodicism. Several of these tracks would later appear elsewhere (on recordings by Lizzy alumni Gary Moore and a Lynott solo single), but it was with Grand Slam that Lynott first tried out such tunes as &quot;Nineteen&quot; and &quot;Military Man,&quot; both included here in their original form. As with Lizzy, Lynott continued to tackle lyrical themes that at the time, strayed far outside what the average hard rock/heavy metal band of the era would sing about -- namely &quot;Harlem&quot; and &quot;Gay Boys.&quot; While the first disc sticks to studio work, the second disc is comprised of demos, alternative mixes, and even a radio interview with Lynott, from Ireland in 1984. Although sound and production-wise it sounds a bit dated, Studio Sessions proves that Lynott was still writing solid material up until his passing, and it's quite hard to fathom why Grand Slam was never offered a recording contract.

This release 1995 on OJC.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis CD places Ella Fitzgerald (then 60) in an unusual setting. Joined only by organist Jackie Davis and drummer Louie Bellson, she tackles a wide variety of material that ranges from &quot;I'm Walkin'&quot; and &quot;I Cried for You&quot; to &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (which did not need to be remade) and &quot;And the Angels Sing.&quot; Not one of her more essential releases, Lady Time does show that even at this fairly late stage in her career, Ella Fitzgerald could outswing just about anyone.\n\n01. I'm Walkin'   \n02. All Or Nothing At All    \n03. I Never Had A Chance    \n04. I Cried For You (Now It's Your Turn To Cry Over Me)   \n05. What Will I Tell My Heart   \n06.

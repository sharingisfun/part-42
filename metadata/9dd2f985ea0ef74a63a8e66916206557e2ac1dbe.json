Filming was only 80% finished due to Phoenix's death on October 31, 1993. Production halted while insurers and financiers tried to determine if the movie could be completed, but with important scenes still needing to be shot the film was abandoned on November 18, 1993. For the 2012 release, roughly four to six missing scenes were replaced with ******** Sluizer providing narration. ******* It was revealed in October 2011 that director George Sluizer had held onto the footage, fearing it would be destroyed, and that he had reedited the material and believed that with some adjustments a completed film could be released in 2012. It was speculated that Sluizer would ask\nPhoenixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger brother Joaquin Phoenix to dub River's voice. The Phoenix family made it clear that they wouldn't partake in the project, saying in a statement, &quot;In regard to releasing River's last film, Joaquin Phoenix and his family have not been in communication with the director nor will they participate in any way.&quot; On May 18, 2012, a trailer for the film and an interview with Sluizer were released on YouTube. The film premiered to an invited audience on September 27, 2012, at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht, Netherlands. It had its international premiere out of competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n*** This film was never on sale, a few copies were given to film funders/members of the fan club. ***\n\n\n\n- SAMPLE: Yes\n\n- SUBTITLE: No\n\n- LANGUAGE: English\n\n\n\nDURATION: 1h 23mn\n\n\n\nPOSTER:\n----------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/LTRF7lS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/LTRF7lS&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n-------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/8qIL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/8qIL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDIRECTOR: George Sluizer\n\n\nCAST: River Phoenix, Jonathan Pryce, Judy Davis, Karen Black, T.

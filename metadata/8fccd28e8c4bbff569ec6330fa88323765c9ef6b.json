The conflict that broke out in 1812 seemed born of an almost subconscious desire for a war to complete the separation of America from England begun by the War of Independence (1775-1783). The war, when it came, was bloody and hard fought. In one last attempt to break the deadlock the British sent Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham to capture New Orleans. The troops he commanded were elite, veteran regiments. Andrew Jackson, leading the defenders, commanded a mixed force including militia, free Negro battalions, Indians and a group of local pirates. This title describes how this mixed force decisively defeated the British veterans in a battle that has become part of American legend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fccd28e8c4bbff569ec6330fa88323765c9ef6b","amp;dn":"New+Orleans+1815-Campaign+028","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fccd28e8c4bbff569ec6330fa88323765c9ef6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,204,210,142,140,75,191,245,105,236,99,48,250,136,50,55,101,201,239,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

No multitrack recording was used and consequently no mixing was required. Therefore this CD was made by transfering the  one step analog master to digital.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14e1a4093026dfad0d5d87175271a85aa7e502f8","amp;dn":"Art+Blakey+and+the+Jazz+Messengers+-+A+Night+In+Tunisia+-+please","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14e1a4093026dfad0d5d87175271a85aa7e502f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,225,164,9,48,38,223,173,13,93,135,23,82,113,168,90,167,229,2,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

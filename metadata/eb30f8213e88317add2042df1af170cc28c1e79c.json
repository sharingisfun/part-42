The team remained mostly intact for a further 8 years of adventures, before the Titans titles had some major changes in the late 90's. Marv Wolfman and George Perez were reunited for some of these issues, but with Perez handling Wonder Woman full-time, it was Wolfman who would see this title through to the end with few breaks in-between. \n\nThis is the full run of the series, from issue 50-130, and completes the earlier volume which I had previously posted. The same team worked on these scans - TCR, bluejeff, and DCP. Much thanks to them for their great high-class work with these old comics, please seed and as always enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb30f8213e88317add2042df1af170cc28c1e79c","amp;dn":"The+New+Titans+50-130+%281988-1996%7CC2C%7CTCR%2BDCP%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb30f8213e88317add2042df1af170cc28c1e79c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,48,248,33,62,136,49,122,221,32,66,223,26,241,112,204,40,193,231,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The album contains all of her U.K. hit singles, including four from her stellar debut, Ancient Heart, among those the sublime &quot;Twist in My Sobriety,&quot; easily one of the greatest songs to have come out of the 1980s (an additional dance remix of that song closes out the album). Other highlights include the astounding, heartbreaking &quot;Only the Ones We Love&quot; (quite possibly the best song on this collection), the Phil Spector-ish &quot;You Make the Whole World Cry,&quot; and the haunting &quot;I Might Be Crying.&quot; Another definite standout is this album&amp;#039;s only new recording (and the only cover), which is her version of &quot;And I Think of You&quot; (originally titled &quot;E Penso a Te&quot;). One only wishes other tracks, such as &quot;We Almost Got It Together&quot; and &quot;Valentine Heart,&quot; were accounted for as opposed to so much material from her otherwise fine album Lovers in the City. Tikaram, with her heartbroken, world-weary, smoky voice, is in a league all her own and, because of her early start in the recording business, will hopefully have enough material to some day warrant a best-of volume two.

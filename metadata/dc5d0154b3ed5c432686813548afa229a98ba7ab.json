Now, in her final semester of college, she still struggles against paralyzing fear just trying to speak up in class, and the terror and helplessness linger on in her nightmares.\n\nAcross campus, Owen sees his scars in the mirror every morning while he gets ready for class. They remind him of the broken home he left behind, the father he hates and fears, and the little sister he couldn't protect. Now, in his final semester of college, he's scared that he may have to return to the hell he called home after staying away for almost five years.\n\nWhen Owen becomes a teaching assistant for one of Maria's classes, they find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other. As the two learn each other's secrets and grow closer, they realize that although they may be lost, they're not alone anymore.\n\nFound (Lost &amp; Found #2) by Nadia Simonenko (July 5th 2013)\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find each other somehow. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not lost anymore...\n\nAll it took was one phone call to tear Owen's life apart. His father is dead and his mother is in critical condition. Even though he feared his abusive father and despised his family, losing them hurts in a way he never expected. Just weeks ago, Owen was terrified that he'd have to go home. Now, there is no home.\n\nAll it took was one phone call to shatter Maria's happily-ever-after and bring her nightmares back to life. Maria's estranged brother is coming up to see her graduation and he isn't coming alone. He's bringing Maria's parents, as she expected, but he's also bringing along an old friend from collegeÃ¢â‚¬â€someone who's haunted Maria's nightmares for seven years. Now, she's about to come face to face with the man who ruined her life.\n\nWill the love and happiness Maria and Owen found be enough to hold them together as their lives fall apart around them, or will their relationship slip away and be lost forever?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5d0154b3ed5c432686813548afa229a98ba7ab","amp;dn":"Lost+%26amp%3B+Found+Series+%281-2%29+by+Nadia+Simonenko+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5d0154b3ed5c432686813548afa229a98ba7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,93,1,84,179,237,92,67,38,134,129,53,72,175,162,41,169,139,167,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

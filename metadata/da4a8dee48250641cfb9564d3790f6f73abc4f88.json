The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ taking their cues from their parents ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4a8dee48250641cfb9564d3790f6f73abc4f88","amp;dn":"Naruto+%5BS03%5D+%5BE84-131%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4a8dee48250641cfb9564d3790f6f73abc4f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,74,141,238,72,37,6,65,207,185,86,77,55,144,246,247,58,188,79,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Then watch the monster you created come to life in the story with full motion and sound. When you are finished with a story you can watch them play like movies in Orly's outdoor theater. \n\nKids express themselves best through creative play. Orly is the perfect guide in these activities which teach and enhance listening, storytelling, drawing, painting, and writing. Kids also learn about Jamaican culture.\n\nThis is a wonderful CD packed with sound, music and action for hours of creative play.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nWindows 3.1/95/98/ME, 486/33 MHz+, 8 MB RAM, 15 MB hard disk space, 2X CD-ROM, 640X480 256 colors, sound card.\n\nWe were not able to run this program on Windows XP.\n\nMacintosh 68030 25 MHZ or Power PC+, System 7.1.2+, 5 MB RAM free, 16 MB hard disk space, 2X CD-ROM, 256 color 640X480.\n\nyou may  nead winspool.dll you can download it by google, to play the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bacff5a6e8940c5838f2302a66ec8a15b18013db","amp;dn":"Orly+draw+a+story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bacff5a6e8940c5838f2302a66ec8a15b18013db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,207,245,166,232,148,12,88,56,242,48,42,102,236,138,21,177,128,19,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

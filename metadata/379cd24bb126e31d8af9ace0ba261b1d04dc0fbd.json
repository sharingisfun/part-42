Formed in Dayton, OH, and going through various lineups, the band was comprised of vocalist J.T. Woodruff, guitarists Andy Saunders and Jesse Blair, bassist Josh Bethel, and drummer Andy Lazier for its 2001 album, Nine Reasons to Say Goodbye. The album showcased a band still very much coming into its own, and was stylistically more similar to a young Saves the Day than the abrasive screamo that would later define Hawthorne Heights. As lineup changes ensued, Woodruff would be the only member to carry over into the Hawthorne incarnation that would eventually sign to Victory Records in late 2003. As Hawthorne Heights' popularity grew with the success of 2004's The Silence in Black and White, Nine Reasons was reissued by Confined in 2005. Victory, in conjunction with Woodruff's own Carbon Copy Media imprint, later reissued it again in July 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:379cd24bb126e31d8af9ace0ba261b1d04dc0fbd","amp;dn":"A+Day+in+the+Life+-+Nine+Reasons+to+Say+Goodbye+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"379cd24bb126e31d8af9ace0ba261b1d04dc0fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,156,210,75,177,38,227,29,138,249,172,224,186,38,27,29,4,220,15,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

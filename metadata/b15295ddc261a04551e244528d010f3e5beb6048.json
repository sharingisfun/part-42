Except for the &quot;1st Battalion, 5th SFG&quot; \ndesignation, this unit is entirely fictional. They are sometimes referred to as \n&quot;The Ghosts&quot;. Their role is not unlike other real world Special Operations \nForces, in that their operations are kept highly classified.\n\nThe Ghosts are organized into three fireteams named using the NATO phonetic \nalphabet: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie allowing for a distribution of three \nsoldiers per team. However, since the player can only assign a total of six men in \na single player mission, it is not uncommon for one of the fireteams to be \ndisregarded, depending on the preference of the player. The player enjoys \nlimited tactical control on the battlefield environment, and can issue maneuver \ncommands as well as rules of engagement for each of the fireteams through a \ncommand map.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15295ddc261a04551e244528d010f3e5beb6048","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancy%27s+Ghost+Recon+%281-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15295ddc261a04551e244528d010f3e5beb6048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,82,149,221,194,97,160,69,81,226,68,82,141,1,15,62,91,235,96,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

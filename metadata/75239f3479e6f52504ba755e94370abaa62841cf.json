With a brilliantly fleet technique and fertile melodic imagination, Pastorius made his fretless electric bass leap out from the depths of the rhythm section into the front line with fluid machine-gun-like passages that demanded attention. He also sported a strutting, dancing, flamboyant performing style and posed a further triple-threat as a talented composer, arranger and producer. He and Stanley Clarke were the towering influences on their instrument in the 1970s. \n\nAlas, Pastorius became overwhelmed by mental problems, exacerbated by drugs and alcohol in the mid-'80s, leading to several embarrassing public incidents (one was a violent crack-up on-stage at the Hollywood Bowl in mid-set at the 1984 Playboy Jazz Festival). Such episodes made him a pariah in the music business and toward the end of his life, he had become a street person, reportedly sighted in drug-infested inner-city hangouts. He died in 1987 from a physical beating sustained while trying to break into the Midnight Club in Fort Lauderdale. Almost totally forgotten at the time of his death, Pastorius was immediately canonized afterward (Marcus Miller wrote a tune &quot;Mr. Pastorius&quot; in his honor, as have many others over the years). \n\n\nGenre................: Jazz\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Epic/Legacy\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audio Checker, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Donna Lee\n02.Come On, Come Over\n03.Continuum\n04.Kuru/Speak Like A Child\n05.Portrait Of Tracy\n06.Opus Pocus\n07.(Used To Be A) Cha-Cha\n08.Bright Size Life\n09.Barbary Coast\n10.Hejira\n11.Talk To Me\n12.Birdland\n13.A Remark You Made\n14.Teen Town\n15.Havona\n\nCD2\n\n01.River People\n02.Punk Jazz\n03.The Dry Cleaner From Des Moines\n04.Dreamland\n05.4 A.M.\n06.Teen Town (Live)\n07.Slang\n08.Port Of Entry\n09.Soul Intro/The Chicken\n10.Three Views Of A Secret\n11.Liberty City\n12.John And Mary\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75239f3479e6f52504ba755e94370abaa62841cf","amp;dn":"Jaco+Pastorius+-+The+Essential++%282007%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75239f3479e6f52504ba755e94370abaa62841cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,35,159,52,121,230,245,37,4,186,117,94,148,55,10,186,166,40,65,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

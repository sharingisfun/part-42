This is his first solo album, and as one might expect, it's a fascinating hodgepodge of differing musical traditions. Happily, Dog My Cat has none of the hippie-dippy multicultural piety that afflicts so many East-meets-West musical experiments -- Manx's approach to the blues is gritty and straightforward, his original songs are tight and tuneful, and when he pauses to play a raga (as he does twice on this album), he manages to imbue the Indian musical form with a soulful depth that somehow has nothing and everything to do with the blues. Highlights are hard to identify on this album because its quality is so consistently high, but his rendition of the Muddy Waters standard &quot;Can't Be Satisfied&quot; is especially fine, as are his own &quot;Love Ain't No Game&quot; and the traditional &quot;Reuben's Train.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fdecf4bc70ac4ccacc24df3ae99fe291a989f07","amp;dn":"Harry+Manx+-+Dog+my+cat.+%5B2001%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fdecf4bc70ac4ccacc24df3ae99fe291a989f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,222,207,75,199,10,196,204,172,194,77,243,174,153,254,41,26,152,159,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

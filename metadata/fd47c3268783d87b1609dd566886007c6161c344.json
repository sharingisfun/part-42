Shaw was discovered by pop singer Adam Faith in 1963, who led her to his manager, Eve Taylor; she released her debut single, &quot;As Long as You're Happy,&quot; the following year. It didn't hit the charts, yet her next record, &quot;(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me,&quot; hit number one in the U.K.; the single hit number 52 in the U.S., yet Shaw was never as big a star in the States as she was in the U.K. For the next three years, she had a string of hits -- most of them written by her producer Chris Andrews -- that kept her at the top of the charts. In 1967, Taylor began to move Shaw into cabaret territory; the approach proved a success when the Bill Martin/Phil Coulter song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; hit number one. She recorded one more Coulter song, &quot;Tonight in Tokyo,&quot; before returning to Chris Andrews. However, none of her further work with Andrews resulted in hit singles. Released in early 1969, her English version of the French &quot;Monsieur Dupont&quot; managed to crack the Top 20; it would turn out to be her last hit.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/sandie-shaw-p20486/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/sandie-shaw-p20486/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012D7NKY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012D7NKY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

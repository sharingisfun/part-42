Press and hold the ALT key.\n2. Type a numeric value using the leftmost side keypad.\n3. Press ALT + F2 to activate experience cheat with this value.\nor press F2 if ALT key is already down at the moment.\n4. Click a unit to apply it.\n\nDone. The procedure is the same with all other cheats, except for\nthe movement cheat, it uses a hard coded value of 99, this is for\nthe sake of keeping the game stable and except for the cargo cheat\nyou can only move 1 unit of cargo per time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoded by DelphiUniverse/CivFart using fasm (flat assembler)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b4a3feed1241c010ed7161ba7a1ed7f5a2155c","amp;dn":"SidFart+Civilization+V+Gods+and+Kings+Trainer+1.0.1.705+Beta9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b4a3feed1241c010ed7161ba7a1ed7f5a2155c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,180,163,254,237,18,65,192,16,237,113,97,186,122,30,215,245,162,21,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

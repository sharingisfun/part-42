Moreover, they want clear, honest answers. The ecumenical movement in their own church has made it more important than ever for them to have this information.\nWritten lovingly to the Roman Catholics, this book uses scriptures to explain major differences between Catholic and Protestant beliefs. So Catholics won't think this is Protestant theology from an &quot;unapproved&quot; Bible, Heinze uses their own New American Bible. The reader will come face to face with the fact that the Catholic church cannot save, only faith in Jesus can.\n\nEvolutionist:\nCould life have formed in the Primordial Soup billions of years ago?\nEvolutionists claim that simple chemicals became concentrated in ancient oceans, forming an organic broth which eventually produced living cells. Is this possible?\nIn 1953 Stanley Miller became famous for his experiment which produced amino acids by passing a spark through gasses which contained the elements that make up amino acids.\nEvolutionists hoped their students would believe without question that amino acids would produce life. But Heinze reveals the facts evolutionists won't tell you. The amino acids produced would not work in any living things. The more recently suggested steps in Chemical evolution will not take place either. The idea is scientifically bankrupt, and the foundation of evolutionary thinking is destroyed.\nFull of quotes from the best known scientists in the field, How Life Began is a great gift for students, teachers and school libraries. Learn how the scientific facts speak powerfully of an intelligent Creator, without whom life could never have begun. Learn how to know Him personally.\n\nJehovah's Witness:\nAnswers you need to witness effectively to Jehovah's Witnesses\nWhen Jehovah's Witnesses come to your door, have you ever wished you could get them off their memorized scripts and show them what the Bible really teaches? Have you ever wished you had the information necessary to lovingly show them why their religion is wrong? Now you can!\nUsing many quotes from Watchtower leaders, this small book exposes the errors of this false religion, presenting thought-provoking questions Jehovah's Witnesses can't answer. Don't turn them away from your door saying, &quot;I'm not interested.&quot; Learn the questions that will make them think, so you can effectively share the true gospel with them.\nDid you know? - In 1889, Jehovah's Witness founder C.T. Russell predicted: &quot;...the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the establishment of the Kingdom of God, will be accomplished at the end of A.D. 1914.&quot; This is one in a long list of unfulfilled Jehovah's Witness Bible prophecies that are revealed in this book.\n\nMormon:\nMormonism stands or falls on the life of its founder, Joseph Smith\nThat's why you (and Mormons who read this book) will be amazed as you learn about Smith's personal life, starting with his early youth and progressing to his later years.\nThis well-researched book also exposes serious problems with the doctrines Smith created, as well as facts you need to know about his abilities as a translator.\nThis easy-reading book provides powerful information to convince Mormons that their religion cannot be of God. It includes a clear presentation of the gospel and an invitation to trust Christ alone for salvation.\n\nAbout the author:\nThomas Heinze served for 34 years as an evangelical missionary in Italy with WorldVenture, first in evangelism and then directing the publishing house, Edizioni Centro Biblico. Since retiring in Portland, OR, he has written five books and two minibooks published by Chick Publications.

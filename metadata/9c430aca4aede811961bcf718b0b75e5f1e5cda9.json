But studies also show that as many as two hundred Canadians a year suffer strokes brought on by neck manipulation. Spin Doctors takes a hard, dramatic, and spine-chilling look into the world of chiropractic medicine. \n\nYou will be surprised to learn what chiropractors treat and why and how much it costs you as a taxpayer. Most importantly, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family from dangerous adjustments, practice-building tactics, bogus treatments, and misleading information.\n\nGenre: Medical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c430aca4aede811961bcf718b0b75e5f1e5cda9","amp;dn":"Spin+Doctors%3A+The+Chiropractic+Industry+Under+Examination","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c430aca4aede811961bcf718b0b75e5f1e5cda9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,67,10,202,74,237,232,17,150,27,207,113,139,11,117,229,241,229,205,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

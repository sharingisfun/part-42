It takes ten days to do this distance and the track leads through seven countries and all terrain types, from asphalt road over dust ways to mud and even snow. Ten days, you are alone with the road and the roaring sound of your engine. With this game, you can participate on one of the most demanding rallyes of the world. You need to race through 30 stages, on all terrain, against aggressive AI opponents, to win the cup. The game is the official Master Rallye computer game.\n\nMaster Rallye is a racing game, based on the trans-European and Asian endurance race of the same name. You race off-road over extreme terrain at break-neck speed, power-sliding around corners, launching skywards over humps and jumps, and avoiding hazards. Vehicle handling is excellent, with advanced physical modeling used to produce a driving feel that is both realistic and great fun to play.\n\nThe game's unique course design offers extremely wide driving areas, rather than narrow, constrained race tracks. This allows players to find their own fastest route over the rough terrain, weaving around obstacles and humps. Extremely wide, open courses, offering a true off-road sensation. Courses are based on official archive data from previous Master Rallyes and the expertise of Rene Metge, the official Master Rallye course designer and previous three time Paris-Dakar champion.\n\nGame Features:\n\n-Massive race over the 8 countries of the official Master Rallye (France, Italy, Germany/Austria, Russia, Turkey, Spain/Portugal), featuring a wide range of race stages over extreme terrain.\n\n-Full 180 degrees-of-freedom vehicle physics model, allowing gamers to fully experience the thrills of off-road cross-country rallying for the first time.\n\n-42 visually detailed and appealing locations, with realistic landscapes and vehicles. Over 400 square kms of tracks.\n\n-Excellent replay value through many different play modes, including arcade, simulation, LAN and network. \n\n-Advanced behaviour particle/effects system which provides a wide range of realistic weather, surface and localized atmospheric effects.\n\n-Networked head-to-head race with up to 32 players across LAN, and Internet.\n\n-Advanced metallic vehicle shading, realistic outdoor lighting, texture enhancement system, procedural landscape detailing, tyre tracks and ruts.\n\n-Unique 'seeker sense' Artificial Intelligence system for truly intelligent opponents with personality, that react to the player's actions.\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/master-rallye/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/master-rallye/screenshots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ag.ru/screenshots/master_rallye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ag.ru/screenshots/master_rallye&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c1c8463e7b612a056404d4778c6a21ccb4447c","amp;dn":"Master.Rallye.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c1c8463e7b612a056404d4778c6a21ccb4447c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,193,200,70,62,123,97,42,5,100,4,212,119,140,106,33,204,180,68,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

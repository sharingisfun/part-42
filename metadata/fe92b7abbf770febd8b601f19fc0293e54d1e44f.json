This Prestige set (reissued on CD) was his first in a decade and would be followed by another seven years of silence. Fortunately, Farlow had continued playing on a low-profile basis in the interim, and he was still very much in top form. Joined by pianist John Scully, bassist Jack Six and drummer Alan Dawson, Farlow performs swinging versions of seven standards, including &quot;Straight, No Chaser,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember April&quot; and &quot;Crazy, She Calls Me.&quot; Recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe92b7abbf770febd8b601f19fc0293e54d1e44f","amp;dn":"Tal+Farlow+%28John+Scully%2C+Jack+Six%2C+Alan+Dawson%29+-+The+Return+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe92b7abbf770febd8b601f19fc0293e54d1e44f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,146,183,171,191,119,15,235,216,182,1,241,159,192,41,62,84,209,228,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

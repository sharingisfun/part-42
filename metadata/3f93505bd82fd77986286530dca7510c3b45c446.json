The journey takes the former political journalist all over the country including visits to the Hebrides and Somerset.\n\n\n1)  Leeds and Liverpool \nHe begins with a voyage along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the nation's longest at 127 miles. After being measured up for a suit in Leeds and encountering an unfriendly alpaca on a farm in Saltaire, he successfully crosses the Pennines on his barge, heading via Burnley and Blackburn toward the famous Liverpool docks.\n\n2)  Llangollen Canal Wales \nJohn Sergeant crosses the England-Wales border as he explores the Llangollen Canal. Along the way, he gets his fingers burnt attempting to become a blacksmith, travels over a terrifyingly high aqueduct and receives a shock on spotting some racy artwork in a fellow narrowboat.\n\n3)  Aire and Calder \nIn this episode he explores the 34-mile Aire and Calder Navigation, built to connect the industrial cities of north-east England with the east coast. Along the way, he learns how to stone-grind flour in Castleford, tries his hand at aerobics on the edge of a lock in Woodlesford near Leeds, and samples Yorkshire's answer to champagne.\n\n4)  Caledonian Canal \nThe broadcaster continues his exploration of some of Britain's best canals and their history. This week, he crosses Scotland on the Caledonian, which stretches 60 miles from coast to coast, on a journey taking him through spectacular scenery and lochs, and the occasional whisky distillery - much to his delight.\n\n5)  Trent and Mersey Canal \nJohn journeys along the Trent and Mersey in the Midlands as his exploration of some of Britain's best canals and their history continues. As he travels through the Potteries, managing to smash his fair share of ceramics, he encounters a frightening, ghostly tunnel and takes up the challenge of a blind beer-tasting competition.\n\n6)  Kennet and Avon \nThis episode John navigates the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bath toward London, as his exploration of some of Britain's best waterways and their history continues. Along the way, he proves hopeless at making beer barrels, a little better at stoking steam engines, and a real natural with Freddy the narrowboat horse.\n\n7)  Birmingham \nOn the penultimate leg of his voyage exploring some of Britain's best waterways, the broadcaster heads into Birmingham, a city with more canals than Venice. Along the way, he delves into the history of Cadbury in Bournville, enjoys a refreshing pint, finds out why Birmingham is the nation's curry capital - and tries to buy a gun.\n\n8)  Grand Union \nOn the final stretch of his voyage exploring some of Britain's best waterways and their history, John Sergeant navigates his way along the Grand Union Canal, discovering amusing characters and places on his route from Birmingham to the centre of London.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f5b8949c9bb5b9c6dbc4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 3156 Kbps\n * Video: Resolution: 1024 x 576\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 23mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 502 MB average\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVDRip\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f93505bd82fd77986286530dca7510c3b45c446","amp;dn":"Barging.Round.Britain.with.John.Sergeant.4of8.Caledonian.Canal.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f93505bd82fd77986286530dca7510c3b45c446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,147,80,91,216,47,215,121,134,40,101,48,220,167,81,12,59,69,196,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

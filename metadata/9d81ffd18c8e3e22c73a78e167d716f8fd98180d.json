But despite that familiarity, how much do we really know of the inner Julia?\n\nNow more than 200 letters exchanged between Julia and Avis DeVoto, her friend and unofficial literary agent memorably introduced in the hit movie Julie &amp; Julia, open the window on JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deepest thoughts and feelings. This riveting correspondence, in print for the first time, chronicles the blossoming of a unique and lifelong friendship between the two women and the turbulent process of JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creation of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, one of the most influential cookbooks ever written. Frank, bawdy, funny, exuberant, and occasionally agonized, these letters show Julia, first as a new bride in Paris, then becoming increasingly worldly and adventuresome as she follows her diplomat husband in his postings to Nice, Germany, and Norway.\n\nWith commentary by the noted food historian Joan Reardon, and covering topics as diverse as the lack of good wine in the United States, McCarthyism, and sexual mores, these astonishing letters show America on the verge of political, social, and gastronomic transformation.\n\nThough this collection of letters between Julia Child and her savvy friend, cook, and confidante, Avis DeVoto, may be voluminous, its narrative force is immediate. Julia and Avis shared a voracious curiosity about ingredients, gadgets, recipes, and methods that any home cook worth her salt will find wonderful to read. Their testing and tasting in large part fueled Mastering the Art of French Cooking, the now-legendary and game-changing cookbook that Avis, upon reading an early chapter, said &quot;could be a classic and make your fortune and go on selling forever.&quot; Avis was an instant and unwavering champion of the book and shepherded its long journey towards publication stateside, as Julia and her co-authors in France worked doggedly on the manuscript, and there couldn't have been a better or brighter for advocate for the book's target audience. As a mid-century American housewife, Avis participated both eagerly and critically in the renaissance age of culinary convenience: she details her experiments with the frozen, freeze-dried, canned, and casseroled with a wonderful sense of humor and taste. These pieces are particularly fascinating to read now, as we resurrect the slow, local approach to home cooking, and her perspective on what was available to American cooks at that time is a seamless counterpart to her commentary on the cookbook itself, which she praises time and again for its classical richness and modern practicality. Julia writes to Avis early on that &quot;people who love to eat are always the best people,&quot; and certainly nothing could be truer of these two formidable and gracious gourmandes. \n--Anne Bartholomew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d81ffd18c8e3e22c73a78e167d716f8fd98180d","amp;dn":"The+Letters+of+Julia+Child+and+Avis+DeVoto+%282012%29+%28438p%29+%5BInua%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d81ffd18c8e3e22c73a78e167d716f8fd98180d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,129,255,209,140,142,62,34,199,58,120,225,103,215,22,248,253,152,24,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eddc4b8ba847ab4d42f7e0a15c06da22ff946e4","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eddc4b8ba847ab4d42f7e0a15c06da22ff946e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,221,196,184,186,132,122,180,212,47,126,10,21,192,109,162,47,249,70,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

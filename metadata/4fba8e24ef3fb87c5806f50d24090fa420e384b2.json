Following in the artistic footsteps of Moebius, Tanino Liberatore, and Enki Bilal, Pepe Moreno delivers a brutal portrait of New York City in a future that never was. It's an urban battleground, populated by outcasts and misfits - Rebels - and their guerilla war against the nasty powers-that-be... like the Sanitation Police, for starters!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fba8e24ef3fb87c5806f50d24090fa420e384b2","amp;dn":"Pepe+Moreno+-+Rebel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fba8e24ef3fb87c5806f50d24090fa420e384b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,186,142,36,239,63,184,124,88,6,245,13,36,9,15,164,32,227,132,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

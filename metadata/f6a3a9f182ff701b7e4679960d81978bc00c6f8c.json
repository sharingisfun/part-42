On August 10, 1932, Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan's home on Club View Drive in Los Angeles. Duncan wrote about the death in his unpublished memoir: He heard Rin Tin Tin bark in a peculiar fashion so he went to see what was wrong. He found the dog lying on the ground, moments away from death. Newspapers across the nation carried obituaries. Magazine articles were written about his life, and a special Movietone News feature was shown to movie audiences. In the press the death was given a wide variety of fabrications such as Rin Tin Tin dying on the set of the film Pride of the Legion (where Rin Tin Tin, Jr., was working), dying at night, and dying at home on the front lawn in the arms of actress Jean Harlow who lived on the same street. In a private ceremony, Duncan buried Rin Tin Tin in a bronze casket in his own backyard with a plain wooden cross to mark the location. Duncan was suffering the financial effects of the Great Depression and could not afford a finer burial, nor even his own expensive house. He sold his house and quietly arranged to have the dog's body returned to his country of birth for re-burial in the CimetiÃƒÂ¨re des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques, the famous pet cemetery in the Parisian suburb of AsniÃƒÂ¨res-sur-Seine.\n\nIn the United States, his death set off a national response. Regular programming was interrupted by a news bulletin. An hour long program about Rin Tin Tin played the next day Rin Tin Tin was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1623 Vine St. in 1963.\n\nGreta Garbo, W.K. Kellogg, and Jean Harlow each owned one of Rin Tin Tin's descendants.\n\nIn New York City, Mayor Jimmy Walker gave Rin Tin Tin a key to the city.\n\nRin Tin Tin, Jr., appeared in several short films in the 1930s. He starred with Rex the Wild Horse in the Mascot Pictures serials, The Law of the Wild (1934) and The Adventures of Rex and Rinty (1935). He voiced the part of Rinty in the radio shows produced during that era, as well. He was sired by the first Rin Tin Tin and his mother was Champion Asta of Linwood, also owned by Lee Duncan. Lee Duncan gave some of the original Rin Tin Tin's puppies, those from mate Nanette II, to friends such as Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, and Will Keith Kellogg.\n\nRin Tin Tin III starred alongside a young Robert Blake in 1947's The Return of Rin Tin Tin but is primarily credited with assisting Duncan in the training of more than 5,000 dogs for the World War II war effort at Camp Hahn, California.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Rin Tin Tin - Rex and Rinty (1935)\nA 12 episode serial starring Rex, the King of the Wild Horses and Rin-Tin-Tin, Jr. Rex is brought from the island of Sujan, where he is worshiped as a God-Horse, to the U.S. to be trained as a polo pony. He escapes, meets Rinty and with the help of Frank Bradley is returned to Sujan. The natives have been persuaded to turn against their God-Horse, however he is rescued just in time before he is burned as a sacrifice.\n\nThe 23rd (and next to last) Mascot sound serial, with the first two billed names above the title and the cast frame sheets those of Rex, the King of Wild Horses, and Rinty, thereby making the cast order for the human players two less than shown (Kane Richmond is 3rd billed in reality and not first), opens on the island of Sujan, off the coast or eastern Africa, where guarded by jungles, roving beasts and the Sacred Guard, nestles a shrine to a sacred horse, the black Arabian Rex, the God-Horse of Sujan. High Priest Tanaga innocently allows to Americans, Mitchell and Wheeler see the sacred stallion and, with the aid of Martin, they steal the horse and bring it to the United States, where they sell it to Crawford, a wealthy, greedy polo-playing rancher. Crawford attempts to train Rex as a polo horse, but royal Rex (King of the Wild Horses) isn't having any of that, escapes and takes to the open road or, in this case, range. There he teams up with the vagabond dog, Rinty, and they avoid capture by Crawford and his henchmen Jones, Anderson and McDonald. Their activities attract the attention of polo-player Frank Bradley, who befriends the animals and takes them both back to the island of Sujan. Crawford follows and convinces the natives to turn against their God-Horse, and Rex is about to be burned as a sacrifice. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 229 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 229 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a3a9f182ff701b7e4679960d81978bc00c6f8c","amp;dn":"Rin+Tin+Tin+-+Rex+and+Rinty+%281935%29+DVD9+-+Disk+4+-+Serial+in+12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6a3a9f182ff701b7e4679960d81978bc00c6f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,163,169,241,130,255,112,27,126,70,121,150,13,129,151,139,192,12,111,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

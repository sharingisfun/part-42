Since they did not simply re-upload his videos to their channel, they are no longer available on YouTube, and that shows they felt their claim to copyright over his material was untenable. They only brought them down to promote their self-interest. Probably jealous because he was getting more view than hey were and thought they had some right to be the only Carl Sagan tribute channel, even if their production value is deplorable. \n\nSo here we go, internets, the Carl Sagan Tribute Series is back in full, 1-26.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d27a854e650de60994eaf751113d791c018c4d","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan+Tribute+Series+by+Callum+C.+J.+Sutherland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d27a854e650de60994eaf751113d791c018c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,210,122,133,78,101,13,230,9,148,234,247,81,17,61,121,28,1,140,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

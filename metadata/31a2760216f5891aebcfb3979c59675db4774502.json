But is it possible for us, embodied as we are in a particular time and place, to know how people of long ago thought about the body and its experiences? In this groundbreaking book, three leading experts on the Classic Maya (ca. AD 250 to 850) marshal a vast array of evidence from Maya iconography and hieroglyphic writing, as well as archaeological findings, to argue that the Classic Maya developed a coherent approach to the human body that we can recover and understand today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a2760216f5891aebcfb3979c59675db4774502","amp;dn":"The+memory+of+Bones+-+Body%2C+Being%2C+and+Experience+among+the+Clas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a2760216f5891aebcfb3979c59675db4774502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,162,118,2,22,245,137,26,235,207,179,151,156,89,103,93,180,119,69,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

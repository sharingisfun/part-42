When he died in 2002, he was considered to be the most influential sociologist in the world and a thinker on a par with Foucault and LÃƒÂ©vi-StraussÃ¢â‚¬â€a public intellectual as important to his generation as Sartre was to his.\n\nSketch for a Self-Analysis is the ultimate outcome of BourdieuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong preoccupation with reflexivity. Vehemently not an autobiography, this unique book is instead an application of BourdieuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories to his own life and intellectual trajectory; along the way it offers compelling and intimate insights into the most important French intellectuals of the timeÃ¢â‚¬â€including Foucault, Sartre, Aron, Althusser, and de BeauvoirÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as BourdieuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own formative experiences at boarding school and his moral outrage at the colonial war in Algeria.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;To what will be a long debate over the meaning and legacy of Bourdieu's work . . . the Sketch is a useful contribution.&quot;(Jesse Carlson Canadian Journal of Sociology)\n\n&quot;A graceful overview of Bourdieu's life and career. It can profitably be assigned as an introduction to Bourdieu in graduate seminars. From a sociological perspective, it is especially useful as a case study in reflective socioanalysis. A remarkable window onto one of our very greatest social thinkers, it also exemplifies wonderfully his distinctive sociological approach in action.&quot;\n(Mustafa Emirbayer American Journal of Sociology)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nPierre Bourdieu (1930Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002) was professor of sociology at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France. He is the author or coauthor of more than twenty works, including Distinction, Homo Academicus, Pascalian Meditations, On Television, State Nobility, Acts of Resistance, An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, and Science of Science and Reflexivity, the last two also published by the University of Chicago Press.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04f7c8f86834f109a740819112dd00fffcca4bc5","amp;dn":"Pierre+Bourdieu+-+Sketch+for+a+Self-Analysis+%5B2008%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04f7c8f86834f109a740819112dd00fffcca4bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,247,200,248,104,52,241,9,167,64,129,145,18,221,0,255,252,202,75,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

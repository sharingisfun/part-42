For a start, the band line-up remains largely unchanged from the earlier tour, with Lemmy contributing his trademark vocals, although Calvert has been replaced by Michael Moorcock as poet in residence. Several key elements of the actual Space Ritual remain (The Awakening, Sonic Attack, Welcome to the Future), however it is no mistake that the title features the word &amp;#039;party&amp;#039;, and while Space Ritual Alive fully captured the reverential awe of that particular event, the 1999 Party is a wonderful document of the band at their most playful, with even Sonic Attack rendered slapstick by the addition of &amp;#039;boom-tish&amp;#039; drum fills to punctuate the dire warnings.\nWhereas the Space Ritual tour had largely utilised songs from the Doremi Fasol Latido album to fill the musical gaps in Calvert&amp;#039;s original vision, the 1999 Party showcases tunes from the Hall of the Mountain Grill and features the first live version of D-Rider on record anywhere, while You&amp;#039;d Better Believe It and Paradox, which were actually live versions when first issued on the Hall of the Mountain Grill, get their first outing on an official concert album. You get yet another version of Brainstorm, albeit a particularly good one, the first live recording of single Brainbox Pollution, which is an absolute gem, and while this set was purged of all other Doremi material, the 1999 Party paradoxically features the first live recording of Lemmy&amp;#039;s menacing The Watcher - and what an incredible bass-driven rendering it is!\nLemmy would be busted for possession of amphetamines on the next North American tour and sacked from the band, dancer Miss Stacia and kinky saxophonist Nik Turner both left during the next couple of years, and although Robert Calvert later returned in an expanded role as genuine frontman of the band throughout the second half of the seventies, as the band surprisingly trailblazed their way through the landscape of punk/new wave, \nHawkwind would never again be the same band that they were during &amp;#039;73/&amp;#039;74 - if you were weaned on Space Ritual Alive, then Hawkwind Live at the Chicago Auditorium (The 1999 Party) is the only alternate source of the sustenance to which you have become accustomed.

Others include Celia Fiennes who started her many journeys around Britain on horseback in the late 1600s at the age of 20, Tudor antiquarian John Leland, Daniel Defoe, William Cobbett, Thomas Pennant, and William Gilpin, who travelled through the north of England by boat in 1770.\n\n\n1)  Thomas Pennant \nReaders of pioneer, scientist and explorer Thomas Pennant's masterwork, A Tour in Scotland, learned about rocks that could overpower a compass or prove the real age of the Earth, and about a people teetering on the edge of starvation. Can Nicholas Crane piece together the route which Pennant took and solve the puzzle at the heart of it - why Pennant turned back at Ledbeg in Sutherland and undertook an 18-mile trek through rain, bogs and mountains to the obscure island of Inchmaree?\n\n2)  William Gilpin \nWilliam Gilpin's book Observations on the River Wye was a milestone in the development of tourism. Gilpin became the high priest of 'the Picturesque', a new theory of landscape, celebrating the wild and ruined, and it transformed our way of looking at nature. Nicholas Crane investigates one of the truly great river journeys of the British Isles.\n\n3)  Celia Fiennes \nNicholas Crane attempts to follow in the footsteps of 17th-century explorer Celia Fiennes to the very top of the great precipice at Blackstone Edge. An acute observer, Fiennes was fascinated by anything new. Country houses, hospitals and spas: the emergence of all these spelled out the march of progress that she thought made England great.\n\n4)  William Cobbett \nNicholas Crane traces the steps of radical politician, agriculturist and journalist William Cobbett. Born in 1763 in Farnham, Surrey, Cobbett loved the countryside, and his Rural Rides are one of the best-known elegies to rustic southern England. He cared passionately about the plight of humble farm labourers, railing against corrupt statesmen and middlemen. Was the tirade of this farmer's son justified, and is it still possible to find anything of Cobbett Country?\n\n5)  Gerald of Wales \nNicholas Crane attempts to retrace a journey first made 800 years ago. In 1188, writer, scholar and churchman Gerald of Wales set out on a treacherous expedition to recruit men for a crusade against the armies of Saladin, then occupying the holy land. Nick hopes to find Gerald's exact route, from the English border to the remotest parts of North Wales.\n\n6)  Daniel Defoe \nFollowing in the footsteps of author Daniel Defoe, Nicholas Crane journeys over the marshes of Essex and the storm-swept Suffolk coast to what was the heart of East Anglian trade in the 18th century - Norwich. Defoe's Tour reflects his obsession with money, and the making of it through trade.\n\n7)  John Leland \nIn this edition, Nicholas Crane attempts a 300-mile journey through the West Country, using only a 'map in words' compiled by the 'father of English topography' John Leland in the 16th century. Investigating Leland's quest to present Henry VIII with an accurate written record of the English countryside, Crane unearths the Tudor topographer's fascination with King Arthur and evidence of his long-lost submerged forest.\n\n8)  HV Morton \nHV Morton's blockbuster travel books about Scotland celebrate the whole country including its writers and history. But important things are missing from Morton's depiction. Nicholas attempts to discover why Morton was so selective in what he chose to write about.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8123/8jwp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8123/8jwp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/7307/seey.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/7307/seey.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4541/x96c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4541/x96c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3514/qf4e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3514/qf4e.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/4075/ykoc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/4075/ykoc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/4804/2kg6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/4804/2kg6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2036/quj8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2036/quj8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5520/ehcw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5520/ehcw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/3296/48hq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/3296/48hq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5871/qjl2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5871/qjl2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/9254/3hgt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/9254/3hgt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4309/wdar.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4309/wdar.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1b567a72755b5728352b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1513 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: average 694 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.terntv.co.uk/media-centre/programme.aspx?mediaID=1846&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.terntv.co.uk/media-centre/programme.aspx?mediaID=1846&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e8a77514d79f726d644a0125aa0549a275516f","amp;dn":"BBC+Great+British+Journeys+1of8+Thomas+Pennant+DVDRip+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e8a77514d79f726d644a0125aa0549a275516f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,232,167,117,20,215,159,114,109,100,74,1,37,170,5,73,162,117,81,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

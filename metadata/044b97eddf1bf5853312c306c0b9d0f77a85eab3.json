As far as I can see, nobody has a decent copy of this uploaded anywhere else. So crack open a bottle of redeye, skin one up and have a listen to Zachariah.\n\n\nThe Tracks:\n===========\n\nMain titles (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nLagune Salada (James Gang)\n\nWe're the Crackers (Country Joe and the Fish)\n\nWilliam Tell Overture (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nAll I Need (Country Joe and the Fish)\n\nBallad of Job Cain (Doug Kershaw)\n\nCountry Fever (James Gang)\n\nThe Lonely Rider (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nMedley-Camino, Used Wagon Salesman (Jimmy Haskell, Firesign Theater)\n\nCamino Waltz (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nGravedigger (New York Rock and Roll Ensemble)\n\nShy Ann (White Lightenin')\n\nMatthew (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nEnd Titles (Jimmy Haskell)\n\nWilliam Challee as &quot;Old Man&quot;\n\nAnd Intoducing Elvin Jones as &quot;Job Cain&quot;\n\n\nCustomer Reviews\n================\n\n3.0 out of 5 stars Love the album... HATE Amazon's Bit Rate of the MP3 download \nOctober 10th 2013 By Reign Beaux\nFormat: MP3 Music - Amazon Verified Purchase\n\nI had both the vinyl and 8-track of this album way back when. (I still have a vinyl \ncopy.) When I realized this was available as a mp3 download, I was more than happy \nto add it to my digital collection, particularly at the price of $5.99. Sadly, Amazon is no longer providing the higher quality / higher bitrate rips they once \nwere that made me fall in love with them in the first place. The average bitrate for the songs on this album was @ 160 VBR. I was expecting much better. Still, the album was always a fun listen and I'm glad to have it in a form I can listen to once again.\n\nThree stars, (5+1)/2... (five for the album based on nostalgic recall alone and 1 \nfor the mp3 bitrate)/2. \n\nSure, 160 is better than 128 but an average of 256 or 320 is better still. Also, as a Linux user, I can only download one track at a time because Amazon's site creators apparently can't create a truly cross platform web \ninterface/application! As thankful as I am I have the free cloud storage for my \npurchases, I must admit I &quot;cuss&quot; every time I want to add my purchases to my personal library.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Finally! July 28th 2013 By Zachariah\nFormat: Audio CD - Amazon Verified Purchase\n\nI had the vinyl record of this back in 1971, it was stolen after a couple of years, \nand I've been waiting all these years to replace it. It's finally out on CD. I've \nalways liked the music on this movie and CD. I also own the DVD of this movie.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Great music! February 16th 2012 By G. Rene\nFormat: MP3 Music - Amazon Verified Purchase\nI have the vinyl copy of this album but it's fairly beat up. But I have loved the \nmusic on it for over 30 years so I was really excited to see it released in digital \nformat! Yes, it's strange, someone was very stoned when they wrote it, but hey, it \nwas the Firesign Theater...what did you expect? There's Joe Walsh and the James \nGang, Doug Kershaw (a personal favorite of mine and this was the record that \nintroduced me to him!), Country Joe and the Fish, and much more. And I love Jimmie \nHaskell's themes! All I can say is keep an open mind, crank it and remember the 70's!\n\nProduct Details\n===============\n\nAudio CD (June 12th 2012)\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLabel: Master Classics Records\nASIN: B008B0DZGM\n\nAvailable Formats @ Amazon\nSoundtrack is available as MP3 download and CD.\nAudio CD, 2012 - Currently unavailable.\nWe don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.\n\nPrice:\nVinyl - New from $175.00\nVinyl - Used from $10.00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:044b97eddf1bf5853312c306c0b9d0f77a85eab3","amp;dn":"Zachariah+%28Motion+Picture+Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"044b97eddf1bf5853312c306c0b9d0f77a85eab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,75,151,237,223,27,245,133,51,18,195,6,192,185,208,247,122,133,234,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

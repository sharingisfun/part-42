For files that are DVD Audio conversions to Blu Ray, I like to use Daemon tools lite, a free program that acts as a virtual Blu Ray player in your computer.  After you download that program, right click on the ISO file, open with Daemon Tools, then should go to Media Player Classic to play. Media Player Classic seems to be the only media player that plays these ISO's.  Oh, and this is absolutely the best you've heard this album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e88ec28d725bd75c3b806e9fb438beface1c5bc4","amp;dn":"1991+-+Metallica+-+Metallica+%5BBlu+Ray+DVD+Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e88ec28d725bd75c3b806e9fb438beface1c5bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,142,194,141,114,91,215,92,59,128,110,159,180,56,190,250,206,28,91,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

These videos I got a while ago from another tracker but the person who had uploaded them had made a mess of it.  The videos were all named wrong and I had to sort them all out (took me a while).  When I got them a lot of the names were incorrect but now I have sorted these out completely and they are all named exactly right now.  Most of these videos are taken from a video jukebox from what I understand and they are clean without logos on them but a few of them do actually have logos but most are clean which is why it was a problem getting them named right.  The guy who did them didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a clue what all the videos and artists were called.  I have now corrected all these and also checked them all to make sure theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re of good quality.\n\nAll the videos are MPEG and the most common video size is 352 x 288 with a video rate of 2000kbps and at 25fps.  Also the audio is 44.1Khz in 16 bit Stereo.  Some of them are also in a slightly different quality of 352 x 240 with a video rate of 1150kbps and at 30fps but usually itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the 352 x 288 video size.  I have checked them all, some of them are actually 480 x 480 video size, 30fps and 480 x 576, 25fps both with 2500kbps video rate on average.  I noticed that a small number are also 448 x 336 video size at 1150kbps video rate with 25fps but not many.  Maybe there might be a few other very slightly different ones but I have mentioned the main ones already.  Every video is in 44.1Khz 16 bit Stereo sound regardless of what video size, video rate and frames per second they have been encoded at.\n\nThere are 654 videos in total across all 3 parts I have made.  Be sure to get all the parts if you want the whole collection otherwise you are always welcome to cherry pick at the ones you want, simply deselect the videos in say uTorrent before you choose to download them and just download the ones youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re interested in, either way you can decide whether you want some or all of them.\n\nThe entire collection is 39.3 GBs, each torrent contains 218 videos in Parts 1, 2 and 3, all the way through the alphabet from A to Z.  I will seed it for a very long time and once I get it going hopefully lots of people will also help to seed this as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good collection of videos with some of the great artists of the 80s, 90s and 00s.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure it will be popular.  I am glad that I have sorted all these out now.  When I first got them they were so messed up in the naming it was very annoying but I have done the work now so nobody else has to.  If you play all the videos back to back then in total the time it takes to watch them all is 1 day, 18 hours, 52 minutes and 4 seconds so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite a lot of watching.\n\nHope that you enjoy these, if you click my name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpandauBabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you will be able to see the other parts.\n\nMakes a good video jukebox, I recommend loading all these into a playlist in VLC player and then randomise them in shuffle mode to give you a video jukebox experience...\n\nMany thanks for downloading :)\n\n\nHere are the videos contained within this torrent, as follows:\n\n\nPuff Daddy - I'll Be Missing You\nPulp - Common People\nQueen - Bohemian Rhapsody\nQueen - Hammer To Fall\nQueen - I Want To Break Free\nQueen - We Are The Champions\nR Kelly - I Believe I Can Fly\nR Kelly - Ignition (Remix)\nR.E.M. - Everybody Hurts\nR.E.M. - Losing My Religion\nR.E.M. - Man On The Moon\nRachel Stevens - Funky Dory\nRachel Stevens - Negotiate With Love\nRadiohead - Paranoid Android\nRadiohead - Street Spirit (Fade Out)\nRazorlight - Somewhere Else\nRazorlight - Stumble And Fall\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - By The Way\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - Can't Stop\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - The Zephyr Song\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - Under The Bridge\nREO Speedwagon - I Can't Fight This Feeling\nRepublica - Drop Dead Gorgeous\nRichard X vs. Liberty X - Being Nobody\nRick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up\nRicky Martin - Juramento (Spanish)\nRob Thomas - Lonely No More\nRobbie Williams - Come Undone\nRobbie Williams - Feel\nRobbie Williams - Let Me Entertain You\nRobbie Williams - Rock DJ\nRobbie Williams - She's The One\nRobert Palmer - Addicted To Love\nRobyn - Show Me Love\nRocco - Everybody\nRocco - Generation Of Love\nRod Stewart - Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\nRonan Keating - Life Is A Rollercoaster\nRonan Keating - She Believes (In Me)\nRoom 5 Feat.

Two nurses, Louise and Martha, are caring for an invalid patient at his isolated country house in the Wairarapa. Over the past few weeks, a killer has been on the loose in the Wairarapa area, and three nurses have been found strangled in their homes. Conscious of the potential danger, both nurses make sure that all the doors and windows are locked and secure. However, as the night progresses, strange things begin to happen. Are Louise and Martha so on edge that their minds are playing tricks on them?

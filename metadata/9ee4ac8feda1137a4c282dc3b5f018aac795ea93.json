Discussion of this issue appears in pop culture, the academy, and the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€often generating radically opposed views. At one end of the spectrum are those who think that unless God exists, ethics is unfounded and the moral life is unmotivated. At the other end are those who think that religious belief is unnecessary forÃ¢â‚¬â€and even a threat toÃ¢â‚¬â€ethical knowledge and the moral life.\n\nThis volume provides an accessible, charitable discussion that represents a range of views along this spectrum. The book begins with a lively debate between Paul Kurtz and William Lane Craig on the question, Is goodness without God good enough? Kurtz defends the affirmative position and Craig the negative. Following the debate are new essays by prominent scholars. These essays comment on the debate and advance the broader discussion of religion and morality. The book closes with final responses from Kurtz and Craig.\n\nReview\nWritten in clear and accessible prose, this book is a must-read not just for philosophers interested in ethics or the philosophy of religion but for anyone interested in the important topic of God's relationship to morality. The book includes fascinating original arguments not to be found elsewhere; even those already familiar with the views and writing of Craig and Kurtz will discover new ideas from these two important thinkers. (Erik J. Wielenberg )\n\nA nice variety of well-reasoned moral arguments are here articulates. Recommended for anyone interested in issues of God and morality. (Religious Studies Review )\n\nThis is a brilliant, accessible debate and a collection of tightly reasoned essays on God and morality that should provoke stimulating, mature debate among students and scholars in philosophy of religion. (Charles Taliaferro )\nAbout the Author\nRobert K. Garcia and Nathan L. King are Ph.D. candidates in the philosophy department at the University of Notre Dame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee4ac8feda1137a4c282dc3b5f018aac795ea93","amp;dn":"Is+Goodness+without+God+Good+Enough+A+Debate+on+Faith%2C+Secularis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee4ac8feda1137a4c282dc3b5f018aac795ea93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,228,172,143,237,161,19,122,76,40,45,195,181,240,24,170,199,149,234,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

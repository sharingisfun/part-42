Fed-up with everything prior to D-Day being ignored, the North West Europe theatre and the lack of British, Commonwealth and Free Forces they decided to do something about itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe goal was clear Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to make a WW2 mod that featured all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“missingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bits of WW2 history, portray it in a historically accurate way but without detracting from the fun or playability by overdoing realism. In short the kind of game they and their friends would like to play. Rather than a deathmatch gameplay style, Ham and Jam is all about teamwork as were the real battles. Each map is set-out with objectives and as a team you must fight to complete them to win.\n\nFrom the start, Ham and Jam has had an interesting development ethos. First of all, there is no real Ã¢â‚¬Å“teamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, only a few core Ã¢â‚¬Å“leadersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and everyone else is a contributor free to add whatever they like. There is no commitment to the mod full time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can choose to work on it for a month, a week or simply donate a few textures and leave, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entirely up to you. Also we follow a strict policy of Ã¢â‚¬Å“No BullshotsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we will only post pictures of things that actually exist or are about to go into the game.\n\nThe mod is an on-going work-in-progress. We aim to release updates often rather than store them up for months and hope to have an open and productive dialog with our players. Ham and Jam is a hobby for us and something we do for fun and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how we intend to keep the development process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788f9c699df84a7f318664697c8e277e648a5d97","amp;dn":"Ham+and+Jam+-+with+load+screen+bug+fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788f9c699df84a7f318664697c8e277e648a5d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,143,156,105,157,248,74,127,49,134,100,105,124,142,39,126,100,138,93,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After the death of his young sonÃ¢â‚¬â€that drove his wife to the edge of madnessÃ¢â‚¬â€and a war more ferocious and bloody than anybody imagined, Lincoln lived just long enough to see his dreams realized before an assassin's bullet ended his life \n. From humble beginnings, to the most powerful position in the world, to a sudden, shocking end, Lincoln's life story is extraordinary. This is the epic, six-time EmmyÃ‚Â®-nominated miniseries about one of the greatest leaders in the history of our nation. \n\n\n\nAPPOINTMENT WITH DESTINY: SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX - (47:40) - (Resolution: 720x480)\n\n\nFrom the EmmyÃ‚Â®-nominated series Appointment with Destiny comes Surrender at Appomattox, an examination of our nation's decision for peace at the end of The Civil War. \nRobert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant were two men at war. With Lee leading the Confederacy and Grant the Union, both generals were not only in the midst of battle, but also facing inner struggles and personal conflicts. As the death toll began to the rise and morale began to fall, Lee and Grant found themselves in Appomattox, Virginia, at the simple home of the McLean family to discuss the terms of surrender. Narrated by Hal Holbrook, and shot as if captured by news reel cameras, Surrender at Appomattox explores all the details leading up to this last act of a great historic drama.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nFormat: mp4\n\nLanguage: English\n\nStudio: Echo Bridge Home Entertainment\n\nDVD Release Date: June 5, 2012\n\n===================================================================================\n\nSeed and enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d5531eef065b5a16b4ffed10888723deebd50c","amp;dn":"Civil+War+Anniversary+Collection.DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d5531eef065b5a16b4ffed10888723deebd50c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,213,83,30,239,6,91,90,22,180,255,237,16,136,135,35,222,235,213,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

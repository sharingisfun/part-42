The bailout is opposed by several unions and left-wing groups in Greece over new cuts and layoffs imposed on public sector workers. We're joined by Paul Mason, economics editor at BBC Newsnight and author of the new book, &quot;Why It's Kicking Off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions,&quot; who has just returned from Greece. &quot;What makes the headlines are, of course, the riots,&quot; Mason says. &quot;What doesn't make so many headlines is what is happening to real people. We're living in a time where the world has, in the last couple of years, erupted in a way many people thought they would never see again since the 1960s. The underpinnings of this new global unrest are [that] people are sick of seeing the rich get richer during a crisis.&quot;\n\n\n- Foreign Intervention in Syria? A Debate With Joshua Landis &amp; Karam Nachar\n\nWith estimates of well over 5,000 deaths, the uprising in Syria is believed to be the Arab Spring's bloodiest conflict to date. As the toll mounts, calls are growing for the international community to intervene by arming rebels fighting the Assad regime and even direct military intervention. We host a debate on the merits and pitfalls of foreign intervention in Syria with two guests. &quot;I'm not opposed to helping the opposition - the problem right now is that we are not sure who to arm,&quot; says Joshua Landis, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma and editor of Syria Comment, a daily online newsletter on Syrian politics. We're also joined by Karam Nachar, a cyber-activist and Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University working with Syrian protesters via social media platforms. &quot;There's a humanitarian disaster unfolding on the ground,&quot; Nachar says. &quot;[The world has] a moral responsibility to protect the Syrian people.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c9af704c84f9da8ec0442b7bbac4903c86f0b9","amp;dn":"+Democracy+Now+-+22+feb+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c9af704c84f9da8ec0442b7bbac4903c86f0b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,201,175,112,76,132,249,218,142,192,68,43,123,186,196,144,60,134,240,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

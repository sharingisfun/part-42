Ricky Ross and the band really did a fine job with this classic album. Intelligent lyrics, expressive vocals, original and not overproduced sound, and especially a delicate and relaxing feeling that pervade it from start to end, make of this album the ideal friend for many rainy days. Just relax on a sofa and listen: it will feed your soul and warm your coldest moment. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 19\nArtist: Deacon Blue\nAlbum: Raintown\nYear: 1987\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5eba5515be54d445b892c9f5ef390c535555dd","amp;dn":"Deacon+Blue+-+Raintown+%5BFLAC-1987%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5eba5515be54d445b892c9f5ef390c535555dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,94,186,85,21,190,84,212,69,184,146,201,245,239,57,12,83,85,85,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

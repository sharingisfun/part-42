WPF is built into Windows Vista and also runs on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. WPF allows rich client applications to take full advantage of the graphical capabilities of a modern PC. Its powerful and flexible programming model integrates support for flexible layout, high-quality text, resolution-independent graphics, animation, video and 3D. While it is designed to exploit the full capabilities of today's high-performance graphics cards, it offers high-level abstractions that offer great power to the developer for less development effort than ever before. This course will introduce practicing .NET developers to the new programming models and UI features introduced by WPF.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22ced8e9e8c5659543ca79f1fd85373fe2e7a44","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+WPF+and+XAML+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22ced8e9e8c5659543ca79f1fd85373fe2e7a44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,44,237,142,158,140,86,89,84,60,167,159,31,216,83,115,254,46,122,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

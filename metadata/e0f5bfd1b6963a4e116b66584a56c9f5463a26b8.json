Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the    :\n : unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly,            :\n : opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most  :\n : indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page :\n : of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.                         :\n :                                                                            :\n : The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have:\n : lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup  :\n : of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with  :\n : Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together:\n : by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective        :\n : spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into :\n : something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the        :\n : quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their         :\n : relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the    :\n : face of culture and tradition?                                             :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f5bfd1b6963a4e116b66584a56c9f5463a26b8","amp;dn":"Helen+Simonson+Major+Pettigrew+s+Last+Stand+2010+Retail+EPUB+eBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f5bfd1b6963a4e116b66584a56c9f5463a26b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,245,191,209,182,150,58,78,17,107,102,88,74,86,201,245,70,58,38,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

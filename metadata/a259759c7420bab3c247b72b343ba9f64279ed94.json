Braxton, who is always up for unique collaborations,\nplayed and recorded with Szabados in the early '80s. Adding luster to the match\nup is the presence of former Ganelin Trio percussionist Vladimir Tarasov, who is\nbased in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\n&quot;Trioton,&quot; the 32-minute showpiece of the CD, reflects those compositional\nsmarts. Organized in a theatrical fashion, with each musician expressing his\ndelineated role, there are times when the piece could be a radio drama with the\ninstruments taking the place of the actors' voices. Zestful and refreshing, the\nthirty-plus minutes flash by with the speed of a three-minute pop song. Set up\nby gentle clinks on Tarasov's cymbals, claves and bells, interspersed with\nsilences, the initial statement arises from the flutter and buzz of Braxton's\nsaxophone plus single low-frequency piano chords from the composer.\n\nSoon Szabados' wiggling arpeggios have been dynamically transformed into a\ntwo-handed prelude that's reminiscent of some of Cecil Taylor's orchestral\nwork. With taps, rattles, and shakes from the percussionist operating as a bed\non which the disciplined close voicing of the piano keys lie to extend the\ntheme, Braxton moves to the forefront, working out oblique double-tongued\nvariations. Behind him, Szabados' contributions reflect his dual background, at\ntimes as straightforward as Wynton Kelly, often this side of florid, as per a\nromantic recital pattern. Rumbled snares and toms midway through cause the\nsaxman to reed bites as his higher overtones vibrate out a secondary,\ncomplementary theme.\n\nA reminder of Tarasov's little-heard dexterity, Braxton's teamwork as an\ninstrumentalist, and the scope of Szabados' compositional power almost unknown\nin the West, TrioTone is an archetypal achievement.\n\n--\n\nBy Matthew Sumera &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.onefinalnote.com/reviews/b/braxton-anthony/triotone.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.onefinalnote.com/reviews/b/braxton-anthony/triotone.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy John Fordham &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jan/07/classicalmusicandopera.jazz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jan/07/classicalmusicandopera.jazz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Dan Warburton &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/000734.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/000734.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a259759c7420bab3c247b72b343ba9f64279ed94","amp;dn":"Anthony+Braxton%2C+Gyorgy+Szabados%2C+Vladimir+Tarasov+-+Triotone+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a259759c7420bab3c247b72b343ba9f64279ed94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,89,117,156,116,32,186,179,194,71,183,43,52,59,169,246,66,121,237,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This is a nice soundboard recording dating back nearly 40 years. I have seen this show posted before from CDR's and I tried to get a copy for comparison but was not able to. That version is noted to have issues with tape hiss so based on that I suspect my version sounds closer to the source. If anyone has that version I would like to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine Glenn and David jamming for a show this weekend.

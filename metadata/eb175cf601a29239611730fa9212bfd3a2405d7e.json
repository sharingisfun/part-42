T-Pain - Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor)(Xvid-2nafish)\n\n\n\nThis video has no logos or titles.\n\n\n&quot;Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)&quot; is a song by hip-hop artist and rapper Pitbull released as the first single from his album, Planet Pit. It features T-Pain. It was released digitally on September 14, 2010. The song was produced by Parisian electro-house producer Sandy Vee.\n\nAmar Toor from Aol Radio Blog said that the song is &quot;a pulsating rhythm and electrified beats, the track seems like it's tailor-made for South Beach's hottest dance floors. [...] Pitbull's reggaeton roots are evident throughout &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, as a persistent, pulsating beat keeps the song grooving along, from start to finish. And as always, T-Pain puts his own indelible, Auto-Tuned stamp on the song, as he croons, &quot;Hey Baby ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ you can be my girl I can be your man / And we can pump this jam however you want.&quot;\n\nAccording with an interview from Pitbull in MTV News, the music video was filmed in Miami.\n\nArmando Christian PÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rez (born January 15, 1981), better known by his stage name Pitbull, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and producer.

Each track was remastered and the set came with a running commentary from Rod Smallwood. Covering all of their singles from their first (1980's &quot;Running Free&quot;) to 2000's &quot;Out of the Silent planet&quot;, many of the band's original B-sides were excluded from the collection: &quot;Mission From 'Arry&quot; (from &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;, 1984); &quot;Bayswater Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot; (from &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;, 1992); &quot;I Live My Way&quot; (from &quot;Man on the Edge&quot;, 1995); as well as their cover of Thin Lizzy's &quot;Massacre&quot; (from &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;, 1988) and a number of live B-sides. It is described on the band's website as &quot;a collection that not only reveals much about the band as individuals and the inherent character of the band, but also provides a real insight into who and where their influences came from.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\t\n01. \t&quot;Burning Ambition&quot;   \t \t2:42\n02. \t&quot;Drifter&quot; (live) \t\t6:03\n03. \t&quot;Invasion&quot;   \t\t2:39\n04. \t&quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; (live) \t\t5:28\n05. \t&quot;I've Got the Fire&quot;   \t\t2:39\n06. \t&quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;   \t\t3:56\n07. \t&quot;Rainbow's Gold&quot;   \t\t4:59\n08. \t&quot;King of Twilight&quot;   \t \t4:53\n09. \t&quot;Reach Out&quot;  \t3:33\n10. \t&quot;That Girl&quot;   \t \t5:05\n11. \t&quot;Juanita&quot;   \t\t3:47\n12. \t&quot;The Sheriff of Huddersfield&quot;   \t\t3:35\n13. \t&quot;Black Bart Blues&quot;   \t6:41\n14. \t&quot;Prowler '88&quot;   \t\t4:09\n15. \t&quot;Charlotte the Harlot '88&quot;  \t4:13\n\nDisc 2\n\n01. \t&quot;All in Your Mind&quot;   \t4:31\n02. \t&quot;Kill Me Ce Soir&quot;   \t6:17\n03. \t&quot;I'm a Mover&quot;   \t \t3:29\n04. \t&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;   \t \t2:42\n05. \t&quot;Nodding Donkey Blues&quot;   \t \t3:17\n06. \t&quot;Space Station No. 5&quot;   \t \t3:47\n07. \t&quot;I Can't See My Feelings&quot;   \t \t3:50\n08. \t&quot;Roll over Vic Vella&quot; \t4:48\n09. \t&quot;Justice of the Peace&quot;   \t \t3:33\n10. \t&quot;Judgement Day&quot;   \t\t4:04\n11. \t&quot;My Generation&quot;   \t \t3:37\n12. \t&quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;   \t\t4:50\n13. \t&quot;Blood on the Worlds Hands&quot; (live) \t\t6:07\n14. \t&quot;The Aftermath&quot; (live) \t6:45\n15. \t&quot;Futureal&quot; (live) \t\t3:01\n16. \t&quot;Wasted Years '99&quot; (live) \t \t5:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3a6ffe7904cd71bc7bd7104eebd7f434ece858","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Best+Of+The+B-Sides+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3a6ffe7904cd71bc7bd7104eebd7f434ece858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,58,111,254,121,4,205,113,188,123,215,16,78,235,215,244,52,236,232,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

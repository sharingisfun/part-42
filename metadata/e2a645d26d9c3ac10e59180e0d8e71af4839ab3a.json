This edition quickly went out of print and for many years it remained out of print as Trident Comics had gone out of business in 1991. It was later reprinted by Oni Press in 1998, in Black and White.\n\nSt.Swithin's Day tells the story of an alienated British teenager in the 1980s and in particular, Margaret Thatcher's time as British Prime Minister.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a645d26d9c3ac10e59180e0d8e71af4839ab3a","amp;dn":"Grant+Morrison+-+St.+Swithin%27s+Day.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a645d26d9c3ac10e59180e0d8e71af4839ab3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,166,69,210,109,156,58,193,14,89,24,14,13,142,113,175,72,57,171,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Input saturation leads to controller windup, removable by structural modification during compensator realization and plant windup which calls for additional dynamics. This book presents solutions to the windup prevention problem for stable and unstable single-input-single-output and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c5df2e07e747bd21b28038d958432bb1865f8a6","amp;dn":"Windup+in+Control+-+Its+Effects+and+Their+Prevention","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c5df2e07e747bd21b28038d958432bb1865f8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,93,242,224,126,116,123,210,27,40,3,141,149,132,50,187,24,101,248,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

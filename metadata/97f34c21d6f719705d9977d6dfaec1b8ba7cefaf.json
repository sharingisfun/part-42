The program follows the efforts of two rival teams of astronomers as they search for exploding stars, map out gigantic cosmic patterns of galaxies, and grapple with the ultimate questions: what is the size and shape of the universe, and how will it end. Watch now before you fly apart.\n\n\n\nVideo: XVID 640x368 29.97fps 1159Kbps \nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 112Kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f34c21d6f719705d9977d6dfaec1b8ba7cefaf","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+Runaway+Universe+%282000%29+DVDrip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f34c21d6f719705d9977d6dfaec1b8ba7cefaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,243,76,33,214,247,25,112,93,153,119,214,223,174,193,184,186,124,239,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

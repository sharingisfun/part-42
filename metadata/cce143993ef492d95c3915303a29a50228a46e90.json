In Designing Interactions, Bill Moggridge, designer of the first laptop computer (the GRiD Compass, 1981) and a founder of the design firm IDEO, tells us stories from an industry insiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s viewpoint, tracing the evolution of ideas from inspiration to outcome.\n\nMoggridge and his interviewees discuss why a personal computers have windows in desktops, what made PalmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handheld organizers so successful, what turns a game into a hobby, why Google is the search engine of choice, and why 30 million people in Japan choose the i-mode service for their cell phones. And Moggridge tells the story of his own design process and explains the focus on people and prototypes that has been successful at IDEOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how the needs and desires of people can inspire innovative designs and how prototyping methods are evolving for the design of digital technology.\n\n----------------------\n\nIndividual chapters and video interviews can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ebookdb.org/item/350/Designing-Interactions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ebookdb.org/item/350/Designing-Interactions&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce143993ef492d95c3915303a29a50228a46e90","amp;dn":"Designing+Interactions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce143993ef492d95c3915303a29a50228a46e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,225,67,153,62,244,146,217,92,57,21,48,58,41,165,2,40,164,110,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

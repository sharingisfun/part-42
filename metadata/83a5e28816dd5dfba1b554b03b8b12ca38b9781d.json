They have experienced intense love or loss, grief or loneliness, displacement or disconnectionÃ¢â‚¬â€and exist in a twilight realm, in a place by the window late at night when the streets are empty and the world appears to be quiet. But it is not, and neither are you. And since you cannot sleep, you stay awake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a5e28816dd5dfba1b554b03b8b12ca38b9781d","amp;dn":"Stay+Awake+-+Dan+Choan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a5e28816dd5dfba1b554b03b8b12ca38b9781d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,165,226,136,22,221,93,251,161,181,84,176,59,139,18,202,56,185,120,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

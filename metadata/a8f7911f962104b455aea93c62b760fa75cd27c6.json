All four creator/performers went on to major careers on stage and screen, most notably Moore, whose Hollywood films included &quot;Arthur&quot; and &quot;10.&quot; The quartet comedy - though high-brow - is now seens as a link between the zaniness of Britain's Goons and the cheeky, surreal comedy of the Beatles and Monty Python's Flying Circus. \n\nThis is the only known video of &quot;Fringe,&quot; taped during a gala final performance in London's West End in 1964. Miller had left the show in New York but was coaxed back for a final go. All copies of the tape, which was shown on British television and possibly as a special run in a few American movie theaters, were thought destroyed for many years until one turned up. \n\nVideo cameras 50 years ago were primitive and produced a black-and-white,low-resolution image by today's standards. And sadly, this is not the show at its best - I know because I saw &quot;Fringe&quot; in 1962 during a tryout run in DC. After hundreds of performances, the actors seem weary of the material and some either drop lines or ad-lib bits of dialogue. Still, it is the only preservation of an important show - and much of it remains very, very funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8f7911f962104b455aea93c62b760fa75cd27c6","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Fringe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8f7911f962104b455aea93c62b760fa75cd27c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,247,145,31,150,33,4,180,85,174,169,60,98,183,96,250,117,205,39,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

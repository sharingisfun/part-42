He began his early training on the kaval at the Kotel Music School and The Academy of Music and Dance in Plovdiv/Bulgaria. The kaval, an eight-hole wooden Ã¢â‚¬Å“shepherdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ flute, is one of the oldest Instruments in Europe, rich in tone and technical possibilities. Theodosii Spassov has developed his own unique style of playing the instrument by synthesizing traditional folklore with jazz, fusion and classical music.\n\nFor over 20 years, Theodosii has toured all over Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Canada and United States. In 1994, he performed with Sofia WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Radio Choir which was awarded with a Grammy award for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Le Mystere Des Voix BulgaresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. In April of 1995, Ã¢â‚¬Å“NewsweekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ magazine recognized Theodosii Spassov as one of the most talented Eastern-European musicians in its Ã¢â‚¬Å“best of the EastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ article, noting that Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpassovÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ is not merely surviving the post-communist cultural wasteland. He has actually invented a new musical genre.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTheodosii Spassov has contributed to 20 CDs, four of his own, which have been noted worldwide. He has composed and performed numerous film scores including a French-Bulgarian feature film Ã¢â‚¬Å“GranitzaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, (Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The BorderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) 1993. Also he recorded themes for films by Italian composers Carlos Siliotto and Ennio Morricone, entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“An Italian StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Breakout of the InnocentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. At the fourth European Jazz Night, Theodosii Spassov was a featured performer along with other jazz musicians, including Winton Marsalis.\n\nAt home in Bulgaria, Theodosii Spassov is national figure and musical hero, and was recently honored with theÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Music Artist of the YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ award.

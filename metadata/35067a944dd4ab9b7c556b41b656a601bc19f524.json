Imagine, you are sitting around the campfire enjoying life. And you and your friends in turn are playing your most beautiful songs. Some guitar, some rhythm, mostly the whispering voices of your friends next to you. And a lot of silence, telling you their own small story, while you simply understand flowing with it.\n\nSomebody was dreaming that up while poking the fire. So I invited some friends (or actually they invited themselves) to sit and play (Folk) for you around the campfire. The only thing you have to do is to enjoy feeling life.\n\nIf patience is your weak spot, you can practice a bit with this playlist :)\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie 2012 I3 Hi!

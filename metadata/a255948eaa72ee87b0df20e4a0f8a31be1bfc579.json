Chances\n \nLike an ancient relic from an Indiana Jones movie, the dust was recently blown off the master of Sine Tempus, the third artist album from Goldie, creator of Metalheadz and classics like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“TimelessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Saturn ReturnzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n \n\nComposed in 2004 by Goldie and engineered by Mark Caro (Technical Itch), Sine Tempus was considered to be too dangerous for public consumption and was sealed in an underground vault to prevent infection. From the beautiful soaring strings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Letting GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to the haunting atmospheres and twisted bassline contained within ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Know who I AmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, Sine Tempus covers the entire spectrum of drum and bass, an experience which is unmistakable Metalheadz at itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best.\n \nAlso the soundtrack to GoldieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forthcoming film of the same name, Sine Tempus bridges the gap between music and visual art, taking Metalheadz and Drum and Bass further into the realms of multimedia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a255948eaa72ee87b0df20e4a0f8a31be1bfc579","amp;dn":"Goldie+-+Sine+Tempus+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a255948eaa72ee87b0df20e4a0f8a31be1bfc579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,85,148,142,170,114,238,135,176,223,32,228,160,248,163,27,225,191,197,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

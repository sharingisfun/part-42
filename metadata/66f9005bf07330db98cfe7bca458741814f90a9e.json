Text now scales relative to the anchor point, which does not move. \n-File Open dialogs have been updated to allow you to browse and open files from mobile devices. \n-Fixed a crash that could occur when working with certain files with the maximum file name length allowed in Windows. \n-Fixed a bug that could cause the incorrect clip to be added to your project after capturing from an HDV camera. \n-Fixed a bug that could exit 3D full-screen preview when the mouse was clicked. On glassless 3D systems, this could corrupt the display until full-screen preview was re-enabled. \n-Fixed a bug that could cause the first frame of an MVC file to appear briefly at the end when previewing the file from the Explorer window. \n-Fixed a bug that could Ã¢â‚¬â€ in some circumstances Ã¢â‚¬â€ prevent the application from starting after registering. \n-Fixed a bug that could prevent the application from being uninstalled properly. \n-Fixed a bug that could require you to re-enter your serial number after updating the software. \n-Fixed a bug that could cause image sequences to have black frames in Video Preview and rendered output after zooming in with the Event Pan/Crop plug-in and time compressing. \n-Fixed a bug that prevented the application from prompting to associate the .vf file type with Movie Studio.\n\nSystem Requirements\nThe following lists the minimum system requirements for using Sony Creative Software Inc.

It was published by Marvel between 2004-2006\n\nThe first arc ran through issues #1-6 and featured a new teenaged heroine, AraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a. The second arc, in issues #7-12, published after a short hiatus, featured a revamped female Scorpion and a back-up story featuring the character called Vampire by Night (a re-imagining of the Werewolf by Night concept and a lead-up to Nick Fury's Howling Commandos).\n\nIn issues #13-14, the main feature was a two-part story featuring a new hero, Vegas, with western themes in a modern setting, while the back-up story re-introduced Captain Universe.\n\nIn an attempt to replicate history, Marvel announced that the new issue #15 would introduce a new generation of heroes in a 48-page standalone issue, in the hopes that they would become as popular as Spider-Man. These heroes included Mastermind Excello, Blackjack, the Great Video, Monstro, Heartbreak Kid, Positron and &quot;the guy in Spider-Man's armpit&quot; (who was on the original 1962 cover). \n\nThe final arc, in issues #16-20, introduce Death's Head 3.0, a revamp of the Marvel UK character, written by the original version's creator, Simon Furman. Issues #18-19 contain two Tales of the New Universe stories as back-up features, while #20 featured a Western-themed backup.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e8834f65b2216075725927eff26ecc83256b3fb","amp;dn":"Amazing+Fantasy+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e8834f65b2216075725927eff26ecc83256b3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,136,52,246,91,34,22,7,87,37,146,126,255,38,236,200,50,86,179,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

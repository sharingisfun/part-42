The series volumes are not the outcome of a symposium. Rather, each editor has the potential to examine a chosen area with a broad perspective, both in subject matter as well as in the choice of chapter authors. The international perspective, especially with regard to public health initiatives, is emphasized where appropriate. The editors, whose trainings are both research- and practice-oriented, have the opportunity to develop a primary objective for their book; define the scope and focus, and then invite the leading authorities from around the world to be part oftheir initiative. The authors are encouraged to provide an overview of the field, discuss their own research, and relate the research findings to potential human health consequences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171145f0c5eebbcf1392edcc735bd17faddea4f3","amp;dn":"Epilepsy+and+the+Ketogenic+Diet+Edited+by+Stafstrom%2C+Rho%2C+Schwar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171145f0c5eebbcf1392edcc735bd17faddea4f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,17,69,240,197,238,187,207,19,146,237,204,115,91,209,127,173,222,164,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

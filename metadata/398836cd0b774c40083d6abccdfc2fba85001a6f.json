Meth Drinker released a self-titled album in 2011 in a pressing of 100 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and 100 CDs through guitarist Sam's record label Always Never Fun Records but after making little effort to push the release the band went on hiatus as drummer Tony travelled overseas.\n\n\nDuring this break Meth Drinker's releases and youtube vids were picked up a number of influential metal blogs and interest in the band began to increase leading to the first pressing of vinyl selling out. In 2012 a spilt 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ vinyl album was released with Hamilton's doom-sludge band Open Tomb. In 2013 a second edition of 300 Meth Drinker albums were pressed and in May the band embarked on a 27 show tour of Europe and Ireland with Graves at Sea and Dead Instrument.\n\nLineup\nJames Quick: Bass/Vocals\nSam Thurston: Guitars\nTony Pearson: Drums/Vocals\n\nTracklist\n01 deprivation\n02 incurable illness\n03 ganja mutt\n04 combat shock\n05 skull smashing concrete\n06 the shining (main title)\n07 serrated corridor\n08 narco sub\n09 broken down &amp; used up\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Did you get a job? Did you call your father? What did you do today? I think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really cracking up, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going crazy. Where are we going to live? What are we going to eat? Shut up! Shut up!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ screams a disturbed lady on the introductory sample of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCombat ShockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the fourth track on Meth DrinkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Meth Drinker. That same song ends with a little Casio melody playing within a bit of crackling thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you wonder whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong with your speakers, until you realize the only thing wrong is the awful music youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re listening to.\nSounds like the kind of music that I must post enjoy and seed .............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:398836cd0b774c40083d6abccdfc2fba85001a6f","amp;dn":"Meth+Drinker+-+Self+Titled+LP+and+Self+Titled+EP++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"398836cd0b774c40083d6abccdfc2fba85001a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,136,54,205,11,119,76,64,8,61,106,188,205,252,47,186,133,0,26,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

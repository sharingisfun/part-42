The series celebrates the soldiers' efforts and the critical role they play in making the country safer. IEDs are the insurgent s most effective weapon and the number one killer of troops and civilians. Using specialised Mad Max-style machines, the platoons can see underground and survive massive explosions. Their mission: to take the hit, so the other forces don't have to.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Welcome to Afghanistan \r\nIn Afghanistan, a decade-old war rages on. Here the Second Platoon of the 23rd Route Clearance Company is on a mission to blow up an enemy bomb, while the Third Platoon must use their massive, specialized vehicles to draw away enemy fire. But not everything goes as planned.\r\n\r\n2)  After the Blast \r\nBoth platoons of the 23rd Route Clearance Company are on the same mission: clear the way for British troops to raid an insurgent compound. However, a critical mistake is made during the helicopter landing and the platoon must think fast to recover.\r\n\r\n3)  Bomb at the Front Door \r\nInsurgents place a roadside bomb at the front gate of the company's base. The situation goes from bad to worse when the platoon's vehicles get stuck in Afghanistan's notorious sandy desert - making the entire convoy sitting ducks.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Heroes-of-Hell-s-Highway-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2139 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1020 x 576\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 29.971 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 667 MB\r\n * Source: DVDRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.locatetv.com/tv/heroes-of-hells-highway/7898375","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e996831604b45b333c2eafe9cbdba39f70902320","amp;dn":"Heroes+of+Hells+Highway+2of3+After+the+Blast+576p+DVDRip+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e996831604b45b333c2eafe9cbdba39f70902320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,150,131,22,4,180,91,51,60,46,175,233,203,219,163,159,112,144,35,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is an arsenal for skeptics and a direct challenge to believers. Along the way, Barker relates the positive benefit readers will experience from learning to trust in reason and human kindness instead of living in fear of false judgment and moral condemnation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffbebf52f37c2edd05d23258e0ec56fd8742dc12","amp;dn":"Godless+%26ndash%3B+How+an+Evangelical+Preacher+Became+One+of+Americ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffbebf52f37c2edd05d23258e0ec56fd8742dc12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,190,191,82,243,124,46,221,5,210,50,88,224,236,86,253,135,66,220,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In the last two years, more than 100 incubators have popped up there, and the number of angel investors has skyrocketed. Today, 40 percent of all venture capital investments in the United States come from Silicon Valley firms, compared to 10 percent from New York. In Secrets of Silicon Valley, entrepreneur and media commentator Deborah Perry Piscione takes us inside this vibrant ecosystem where meritocracy rules the day. She explores Silicon Valley's exceptionally risk-tolerant culture, and why it thrives despite the many laws that make California one of the worst states in the union for business. Drawing on interviews with investors, entrepreneurs, and community leaders, as well as a host of case studies from Google to Paypal, Piscione argues that Silicon ValleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique culture is the best hope for the future of American prosperity and the global business community and offers lessons from the Valley to inspire reform in other communities and industries, from Washington, DC to Wall Street.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d714d75bed53a889e7494c0ff64cfc83996e65d8","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Silicon+Valley%3A+What+Everyone+Else+Can+Learn+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d714d75bed53a889e7494c0ff64cfc83996e65d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,20,215,91,237,83,168,137,231,73,76,15,246,76,252,131,153,110,101,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

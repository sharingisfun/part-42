Animal feed contamination provides a comprehensive overview of recent research into animal feed contaminants and their negative effects on both animal and human health.\r\n\r\nPart one focuses on the contamination of feeds and fodder by microorganisms and animal by-products. Analysis of contamination by persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals follows in part two, before the problem of natural toxins is considered in part three. Veterinary medicinal products as contaminants are explored in part four, along with a discussion of the use of antimicrobials in animal feed. Part five goes on to highlight the risk from emerging technologies. Finally, part six explores feed safety and quality management by considering the safe supply and management of animal feed, the process of sampling for contaminant analysis, and the GMP+ feed safety assurance scheme.\r\n\r\nWith its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors, Animal feed contamination is an indispensable reference work for all those responsible for food safety control in the food and feed industries, as well as a key source for researchers in this area.\r\n\r\nProvides a comprehensive review of research into animal feed contaminants and their negative effects on both animal and human health\r\nExamines the contamination of feeds and fodder by microorganisms and animal by-products\r\nAnalyses contamination by persistant organic pollutants, toxic metals and natural toxins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228093ea3a2a5f92305d9043e54071dc0df0f34b","amp;dn":"Animal+Feed+Contamination+-+Effects+on+Livestock+and+Food+Safety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228093ea3a2a5f92305d9043e54071dc0df0f34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,128,147,234,58,42,95,146,48,93,144,67,229,64,113,220,13,240,243,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

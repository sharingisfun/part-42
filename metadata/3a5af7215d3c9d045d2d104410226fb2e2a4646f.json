Questa musica spesso sarcasticamente umoristica ÃƒÂ¨ molto distante dalle composizioni proprie di Legrand. Eppure suona i pezzi con equilibrio, chiarezza, e la sensibilitÃƒÂ  al mondo speciale di Satie di elegante follia. I famosi GymnopÃƒÂ©dies sono qui, suonati idealmente ad un tempo che ÃƒÂ¨ quasi troppo lento. La lamentela principale contro questo disco ÃƒÂ¨ che avrebbe dovuto avere piÃƒÂ¹ musica (solo 54'), ma ciÃƒÂ² che ÃƒÂ¨ qui ÃƒÂ¨ eccellente, e molto ben registrato.\n\nWho would think that Michel Legrand, well known for his movie music and jazz piano playing, would turn out to be such an excellent player of Satie. This spare, often sarcastically humorous music is extremely distant from Legrand's own compositions. Yet he plays the pieces with poise, clarity, and sensitivity to Satie's special world of elegant zaniness. The famous GymnopÃƒÂ©dies are here, played ideally at a tempo which is almost too slow. The main complaint against this disc is that it should have had more music (only 54&quot;), but what is here is excellent, and very well recorded.\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a5af7215d3c9d045d2d104410226fb2e2a4646f","amp;dn":"Michel+Legrand+-+Erik+Satie+by+Michel+Legrand+%281993%29+%5BFlac+Cue%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a5af7215d3c9d045d2d104410226fb2e2a4646f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,90,247,33,93,60,157,4,93,45,16,68,16,34,111,178,226,164,100,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

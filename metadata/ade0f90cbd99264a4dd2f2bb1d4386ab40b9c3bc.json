It seems that with their previous crackfix, the last boss was invincible. Now, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have no excuse for not killing this bad guy. Have fun.\n\n[Group notes]: What can we say. This is why loaders suck. This fix takes care of a trigger which makes it impossible to kill the end boss, for those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become bored with the game after 15 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade0f90cbd99264a4dd2f2bb1d4386ab40b9c3bc","amp;dn":"Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade0f90cbd99264a4dd2f2bb1d4386ab40b9c3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,224,249,12,189,153,38,74,77,210,242,187,29,67,134,171,64,185,195,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

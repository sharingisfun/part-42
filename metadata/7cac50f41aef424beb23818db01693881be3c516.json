I am aware that this file might be around already.\r\n\r\nThe original flac is the remastered version of the dark side of the moon, and I decided to encode it as an mp3 @ 320 kbps.\r\n\r\nSo, it might be lossy, but its the least.\r\n\r\nJust run it as normal on vlc or whatever player you like best, keep in mind the original audio track fades out.\r\n\r\nAfter the album ends, you'll notice the audio fades in again.  So, that means that this won't loop, and why would it...\r\nI don't believe there is any major sync after the first run.  So if you like, enjoy the rest of the movie, its trippy.\r\nTHC will always enhance the experience.\r\n\r\nSeed and enjoy.\r\n\r\nXOXO\r\n\r\nralfalfa\r\n\r\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'darksideofoz.mp4': f=0/0                                                  \r\n  Metadata:                                                                                                        \r\n    major_brand     : isom                                                                                         \r\n    minor_version   : 512                                                                                          \r\n    compatible_brands: isomiso2mp41                                                                                \r\n    encoder         : Lavf56.40.101                                                                                \r\n  Duration: 01:41:53.88, start: 0.025057, bitrate: 2324 kb/s                                                       \r\n    Stream #0:0(und): Video: mpeg4 (Advanced Simple Profile) (mp4v / 0x7634706D), yuv420p, 1280x720 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 1998 kb/s, 24 fps, 24 tbr, 12288 tbn, 24 tbc (default)\r\n    Metadata:\r\n      handler_name    : VideoHandler\r\n    Stream #0:1(und): Audio: mp3 (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 44100 Hz, stereo, s16p, 320 kb/s (default)\r\n    Metadata:\r\n      handler_name    : SoundHandler\r\n   0.33 A-V: -0.009 fd=   0 aq=   46KB vq=  140KB sq=    0B f=0/0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cac50f41aef424beb23818db01693881be3c516","amp;dn":"The.Dark.Side.of.Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cac50f41aef424beb23818db01693881be3c516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,172,80,244,26,239,66,75,235,35,129,141,176,22,147,136,27,227,197,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She needs professional help. Or thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at least what you or I might prescribe. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because we subscribe to the traditional approach to self perception and method of understanding our own place in the universe. In reality, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing wrong with her, she does things a little differently...\n\nThose familiar with her 2008 album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Courtesy FallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will already know her smoky, raspy voice which encapsulates sadness and songs which explore themes such as solitude and lost love through insightful tales full of witty lyrics and black humour...\n\nJust a couple of short years ago, Dawn released her debut album. Brimming over with brains, beauty and most importantly, amazing melodies. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Courtesy FallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ found Dawn drawing comparisons to the likes of Martha Wainwright and Cerys Matthews and finding critical acclaim at every turn.&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\t\t\tLength\n1.

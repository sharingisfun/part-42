Because of this, the quality was terrible - cassette to cassette copies unto the nth generation with speed errors and tape noise.\n\nThis copy was made on a Revox reel-to-reel half track and digited using Goldwave. Lots of processing later, using both Goldwave and Wave Purity, this is the best quality I could achive.\n\nAny ex-pat who worked in Saudi Arabia will identify with at least one of the tracks. I understand that the band who wrote the lyrics and performed these songs was working for BritishAerospace and were arrested and deported (hence the name of the album) when the tapes came to the authorities attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0d264b47574d0e6c0bd98eeb2205539cb81024","amp;dn":"Exit+Visa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0d264b47574d0e6c0bd98eeb2205539cb81024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,13,38,75,71,87,77,14,108,11,217,142,235,34,5,83,156,184,16,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

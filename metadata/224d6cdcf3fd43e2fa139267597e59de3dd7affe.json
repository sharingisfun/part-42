Please remember to seed!\n\n\n01 - Rose-Tinted (Bloodshot)\n02 - Nooses (On the Looses\n03 - Crassinova\n04 - Rain\n05 - Get With The Times, New Roman!\n06 - Chloroform\n07 - Set Fire To The Rain\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\t\n&quot;SycAmour is a band thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to put in a box. Citing influences such as pop duo, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Panic At The Disco!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the nearly diametric Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Devil Wears PradaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it's clear that SycAmourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots are spread through more than one soil. \n\nThe 6 piece hails from Michigan with one main objective as a band: To motivate love and growth in as many people as possible. Through music that is above all else, emotive, and catchy to boot, Sycamour combines familiar, honest, and theatrical to assure they stick with their listeners.&quot;\n\nWe will rape and pillage your ears, and you will like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:224d6cdcf3fd43e2fa139267597e59de3dd7affe","amp;dn":"SycAmour+-+Obscure+%282012+EP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"224d6cdcf3fd43e2fa139267597e59de3dd7affe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,77,108,220,243,253,67,226,250,19,146,103,89,126,89,222,61,215,175,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

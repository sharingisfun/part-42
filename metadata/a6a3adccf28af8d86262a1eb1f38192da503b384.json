Could such a     \n        creature really exist? Our divers probe the depths of the     \n        North Pacific where the worlds largest known species of      \n        octopus lives. Could these octopuses be a food source for     \n        a monster? The investigation will use various underwater      \n        camera systems, including a tiny camera small enough to       \n        probe inside octopus lairs. Deep waters, rough currents,      \n        freezing temperatures and the prospect of encountering a      \n         20-ton boneless horror make this a dangerous expedition.      \n                                                                      \n                                                                    \n                                                                 \n        Release  Notes    \n                                    \n                                       \n                                                                 \n        this is hybrid and mostly film. about 90 film so I went      \n         23.976 and blending the video parts down to smooth them.      \n                                                                      \n                                                                    \n                                                                 \n         Group Greets     \n                                    \n                                       \n                                                                 \n                          CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                       \n           and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                    \n      Contact Info      \n                                     \n                                       \n                                                                 \n      We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                      \n          * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                       \n        GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                    so please dont ask.

It produced three singles (&quot;There You Go&quot;, &quot;Most Girls&quot;, and &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot;) and peaked at number twenty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200. Producers included Kevin &quot;She'kspere&quot; Briggs, Babyface, Kandi Burruss, Terence &quot;Tramp Baby&quot; Abney, Daryl Simmons, and Tricky, and Pink shared co-writing credit on seven of the album's tracks. This album featured a contemporary R&amp;B sound; Pink went for a more pop-rock oriented sound on her follow-up albums. She later went on to admit that during the period of promoting this album, she felt trapped because she wasn't expressing her full musical influences. This was considered to be Pink's start up album, with album sales of 2.1 million copies in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Split Personality&quot; (Terence &quot;Tramp-Baby&quot; Abney, Babyface, Alecia Beth Moore) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:01\n   2. &quot;Hell Wit Ya&quot; (Kevin &quot;She'kspere&quot; Briggs, Kandi Burruss, D.

Jackson - Wine Tasting A Professional Handbook [ENG] [PDF]\n\n\nOne of the most respected professionals in the wine industry-Ron Jackson, author of Wine Science (now in its second edition)- covers all practical and theoretical aspects of wine tasting in his new book. It details the basic techniques used by professionals to sense all visual, gustatory, and olfactory wine properties (sight, taste, and smell). It also describes the physiologic, psychologic, and physicochemical origins of sensory perception and discusses wine types to illustrate the characteristic features that distinguish the majority of wines.\n\nA large portion of the book is dedicated to the practical concerns of preparing and performing wine assessments. Readers are instructed in how to differentiate between the various types of wine tastings (each requiring its own design, tasting sheets, training, skill measurement, and analysis). Included is a general overview of the types and sources of wine quality and how wine is most appropriately paired with food. Special features include a flow chart of wine tasting steps, details of errors to avoid, procedures for training and testing sensory skills, sample tasting sheets, original data from 14+ years of training tasters, and numerous tables, charts, and figures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0be982beff05469ff968360ed3611d92155785","amp;dn":"Ronald+S.+Jackson+-+Wine+Tasting+A+Professional+Handbook+%5BENG%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0be982beff05469ff968360ed3611d92155785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,11,233,130,190,255,5,70,159,249,104,54,14,211,97,29,146,21,87,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

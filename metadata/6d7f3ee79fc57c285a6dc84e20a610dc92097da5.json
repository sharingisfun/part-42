STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRING AND LOVE THE BOMB - 1964\n\nIMDb Rating: 8.7\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/\n\n  Arguably the greatest black comedy ever made, Stanley Kubrick's cold-war classic is the ultimate satire of the nuclear age. Beginning when General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a maniacal warrior obsessed with &quot;the purity of precious bodily fluids,&quot; mounts his singular campaign against Communism by ordering a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviets counter the threat with a so-called &quot;Doomsday Device,&quot; and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart. Sellers also plays a British military attache and the mad bomb-maker Dr. Strangelove; George C. Scott is outrageously frantic as General Buck Turgidson, whose presidential advice consists mainly of panic and statistics about &quot;acceptable losses.&quot;\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, George C.

Packed with illustrative examples and case studies, this book:\n\nDiscusses problems in material and energy balances related to chemical reactors\nExplains the concepts of dimensions, units, psychrometry, steam properties, and conservation of mass and energy\nDemonstrates how MATLABÃ‚Â® and SimulinkÃ‚Â® can be used to solve complicated problems of material and energy balances\nShows how to solve steady-state and transient mass and energy balance problems involving multiple-unit processes and recycle, bypass, and purge streams\nDevelops quantitative problem-solving skills, specifically the ability to think quantitatively (including numbers and units), the ability to translate words into diagrams and mathematical expressions, the ability to use common sense to interpret vague and ambiguous language in problem statements, and the ability to make judicious use of approximations and reasonable assumptions to simplify problems\nThis Second Edition has been updated based upon feedback from professors and students. It features a new chapter related to single- and multiphase systems and contains additional solved examples and homework problems. Educational software, downloadable exercises, and a solutions manual are available with qualifying course adoption","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea90dad22817a0be5ee1e28b2999a93779641f9","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Chemical+Engineering+Processes+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea90dad22817a0be5ee1e28b2999a93779641f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,169,13,173,34,129,122,11,229,238,30,40,178,153,154,147,119,150,65,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The game allows players to assume the role of commanding officer\nduring the battles of World War II that occurred in Europe and North Africa.\nEach country has its respective historically correct military units. Similar\nto the Sudden Strike games Blitzkrieg focuses on battles rather than real-time\nstrategy aspects like base building.\n\nGraphics deliver realistic 3-D rendered isometric terrain and details include\nseasons, climatic zones and weather conditions which can affect game play.\nBlood is present although it can be deactivated. The game features over 350\ndifferent units and objects. The player has the ability to build pontoon\nbridges, dig trenches, lay mines, resupply and repair units or call in air\nsupport but there are no resources. Virtually everything can be destroyed\nincluding buildings and bridges. Forests can be flattened by tanks or\nartillery. Each unit of a respective nation speaks its own language, adding\nimmensely to the immersion.\n\nThe game was shipped with a mission and resource editors for users to create\ntheir own units and maps.\n\nIt was released on May 12, 2003.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTorrent Info\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Blitzkrieg version 1.2, which is the latest version of this game.\n\nThis game has been extracted from Blitzkrieg Anthology\nrelease, which contains no StarForce copy protection system.\nTherefore there was no need for crack.\n\nAll you have to do is extract the game and play.\n\nRIPPED:\n- intro movies have been removed\n- in-game movies have been downgraded to 90% of their original quality\n- all language files except those for english were removed\n\nThis game has been ripped all by me (Eqa5cro),\nand it perfectly fits on a single CD.\n\nThis torrent is virus free, and I can assure you that it will work fine.\n\nAny questions/comments are welcome.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstallation Notes\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

He lives in Sea Cliff, New York.\n\nJason Stafford series\n\nBlack Fridays (#1): Sometimes a man can be redeemed. But not in the way he expects.\n\nJason Stafford is a former Wall Street hotshot who made some bad moves, paid the price with two years in prison, and is now trying to put his life back together. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unemployable, until an investment firm asks him to look into possible problems left by a junior trader who died recently in an accident. What he discovers is big Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there are problems, all right, the kind that get you killed.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not his only concern. Stafford has another quest as well: to reclaim his five-year-old son, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Kid,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from his unstable ex-wife, and then learn just what it means to make a life with him. The things Stafford discovers about himself in the process are every bit as gripping as his investigation, and when the two threads of his life come together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the results are unforgettable.\n\nMortal Bonds (#2): From the author of the extraordinary Edgar-nominated debut novel Black Fridays, a sensational story of murder and financial corruptionÃ¢â‚¬â€and one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continued search for redemption.\n\nWilliam von Becker ran one of the largest privately held investment banks in North America, until the bottom fell out, and the whole edifice was demonstrated to be a fraud.\n\nAfter von Becker dies in prison, financial investigator Jason Stafford is hired by his family. There is still a lot of missing money out there, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s told, and they want Stafford to find it before the Feds doÃ¢â‚¬â€and certain other parties, some of whom are nowhere near as scrupulous in their methods. Bad things start happening to the people Stafford talks to. Soon bad things are happening to him as well.\n\nMaking it worse, his treacherous ex-wife has come to town, ostensibly to visit their young son. Stafford suspects thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to it than that, but even he has no idea how much that visit is about to change all their livesÃ¢â‚¬â€and send him off to the next chapter of his life.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.

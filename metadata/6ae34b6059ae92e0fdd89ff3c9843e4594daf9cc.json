The new Eighth Edition of Halliday, Resnick and Walker has been strategically revised to conquer this challenge. Every aspect of this revision is focused on engaging students, supporting critical thinking and moving students to the next level physics understanding.\n\nKey to Halliday 8eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s support for critical thinking and development of understanding physics concepts is Jearl WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s modern voice and leadership on the author team, and the simultaneous publication of his long-awaited revision of The Flying Circus of Physics. From chapter opening Puzzlers to end of chapter problems, Flying Circus material has been integrated throughout HRW 8e to catch studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attention, engage them, and force students to solve the underlying real world physics phenomenon and concepts, before they begin the more quantitative portion of the content or problem. New problem types in WileyPLUS help move students away from rote memorization and pattern recognition, and allow instructors to assess physics understanding.\n\nJearl Walker is both an active teacher, who understands the challenges faced in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classroom, and a world renown communicator of science to general public. His popular book, The Flying Circus of Physics, has been translated into at least 10 languages, and has just published in its second edition. For 16 years he toured his fun-filled Flying Circus lecture throughout the U.S. and Canada. These lectures led to his national PBS television show, Kinetic Karnival, which ran for several years and won him a local Emmy Award. During his 13 years as a columnist with Scientific American magazine, Dr. Walker wrote 152 articles for &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; section. He has appeared countless times on television (including The Tonight Show) and radio and in newspapers and magazines.\n\nSee the detailed description here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://he-cda.wiley.com/WileyCDA/HigherEdTitle/productCd-0471758019,courseCd-PH1200,pageType-copy,page-tableOfContents.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://he-cda.wiley.com/WileyCDA/HigherEdTitle/productCd-0471758019,courseCd-PH1200,pageType-copy,page-tableOfContents.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Solutions Manual and Study Guide for this course can be found on Demonoid (although they are not bookmarked).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae34b6059ae92e0fdd89ff3c9843e4594daf9cc","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Physics+Ext.+-+8+-+a+BOOKMARKED+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae34b6059ae92e0fdd89ff3c9843e4594daf9cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,227,75,96,89,174,146,224,253,216,159,243,201,132,62,69,148,218,249,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

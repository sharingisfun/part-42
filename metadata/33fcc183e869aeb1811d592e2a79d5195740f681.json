Buckley, Jr. is a good place to start.\n\nBuckley is the godfather of the modern American conservative movement. In 1955, he saw the signs of change that would result in the social revolution that was America in the '60s: black civil rights, the women's movement, the youth rebellion, a more liberal church, and even the first signs of the struggle for gay equality.

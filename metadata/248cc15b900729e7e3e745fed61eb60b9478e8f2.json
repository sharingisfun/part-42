In theory, anyone with an adequate connection to the Internet should be able to tap into a cloud provider and get exactly the computing resources they want when they want it, just like plugging into the electricity grid and getting exactly the energy you want when you want it. But to get that electricity, there are many standards: voltage, frequency, phase, motors constructed in standard waysÃ¢â‚¬â€there is a long list; there is an equally long list for cloud computing. Many of the standards are already in place. Others are being developed; some in contention.\n\nCloud Standards is a broad discussion of important existing and future standards. For existing standards, the discussion focuses on how they are used, providing practical advice to engineers constructing clouds and services to be deployed on clouds. For future standards, the discussion is on why a standard is needed, what the benefits will be, and what is being done now to fill the gap. No current book provides this information in the depth and detail necessary for an engineer in his work, an architect in designing cloud systems, a product manager collecting and evaluating products, or an executive evaluating the feasibility of a project. A second benefit from this book is that it provides insight into cloud implementations. Cloud implementations can be seen as the culmination of many trends in software and hardware engineering. Much of the foundation for these developments have been crystallized in the form of standards like TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transmission Protocol). The book leads readers to understand how these contribute to and affect cloud implementations.

Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will, he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration, a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back.\n\nBut the shot didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t kill Garfield. The drama of what hapÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­pened subsequently is a powerful story of a nation in turÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­moil. The unhinged assassinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s half-delivered strike shattered the fragile national mood of a country so recently fractured by civil war, and left the wounded president as the object of a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle for powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½over his administration, over the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future, and, hauntingly, over his medical care. A team of physicians administered shockingly archaic treatments, to disastrous effect. As his conÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­dition worsened, Garfield received help: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, worked around the clock to invent a new device capable of finding the bullet.\n\nMeticulously researched, epic in scope, and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive, The Destiny of the Republic will stand alongside The Devil in the White City and The Professor and the Madman as a classic of narrative history.\nIn epub and mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e06355009e020b04d3012d39c4fa31c76348071f","amp;dn":"Destiny+of+the+Republic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e06355009e020b04d3012d39c4fa31c76348071f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,99,85,0,158,2,11,4,211,1,45,57,196,250,49,199,99,72,7,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

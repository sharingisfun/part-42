It comprises four CDs and catalogues every track from their four studio albums, plus live material recorded in 1968. The title is taken from the song written by Ginger Baker and Mike Taylor, released on the album Wheels of Fire in 1968.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Jerry McCulley - Cream was the first of three supergroups spawned by the Yardbirds' three stellar axmen (they preceded the original Jeff Beck Group by a year and Jimmy Page's Led Zeppelin by two). The trio of guitarist Eric Clapton, bassist Jack Bruce, and drummer extraordinaire (and band founder) Ginger Baker earned a reputation for fiery live performances rife with improvised blues-based jams (epitomized by Willie Dixon's &quot;Spoonful&quot;) that could last half an hour. Two of this set's four discs are devoted to live Cream, showcasing prowess and interplay so powerful as to overshadow its occasional lapses into self-indulgence. Clapton admirers more familiar with his latter-day laid-back persona may be shocked at the incendiary musician showcased on these live cuts. Cream progressed over the course of its three and a half studio records (included here in their entirety). Electric blues evolution was their forte, but they also captured sounds that were moody and acoustic-tinged (&quot;As You Said,&quot; &quot;Passing the Time&quot;), music-hall-influenced (&quot;Mother's Lament,&quot; &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;), and progressively poetic (&quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart,&quot; &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot;).\n\nDisc 01 \n\n[01] Wrapping Paper\n[02] I Feel Free\n[03] N.S.U.\n[04] Sleepy Time Time\n[05] Dreaming\n[06] Sweet Wine\n[07] Spoonful\n[08] Cat's Squirrel\n[09] Four Until Late\n[10] Rollin' And Tumblin'\n[11] I'm So Glad\n[12] Toad\n[13] Lawdy Mama [Version 1 Previously Unreleased]\n[14] Strange Brew\n[15] Sunshine Of Your Love\n[16] World Of Pain\n[17] Dance The Night Away\n[18] Blue Condition\n[19] Tales Of Brave Ulysses\n[20] Swlabr\n[21] We're Going Wrong\n[22] Outside Woman Blues\n[23] Take It Back\n[24] Mother's Lament\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time 01h:18m:57s\n\nDisc 02 \n\n[01] White Room\n[02] Sitting On Top Of The World\n[03] Passing The Time [Alternate Version]\n[04] As You Said\n[05] Pressed Rat &amp; Warthog\n[06] Politician\n[07] Those Were The Days\n[08] Born Under A Bad Sign\n[09] Deserted Cities Of The Heart\n[10] Anyone For Tennis\n[11] Badge\n[12] Doing That Scrapyard Thing\n[13] What A Bringdown\n[14] The Coffee Song\n[15] Lawdy Mama [Version 2]\n[16] You Make Me Feel [Demo]\n[17] We're Going Wrong [Demo]\n[18] Hey Now Princess [Demo]\n[19] Swlabr [Demo]\n[20] Weird Of Hermiston [Demo]\n[21] The Clearout [Demo]\n[22] Falstaff Beer Commercial\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time 01h:19m:03s\n\nDisc 03 \n\n[01] N.

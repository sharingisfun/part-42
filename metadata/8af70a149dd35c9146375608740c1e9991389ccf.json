Sundberg (Repost)\nPublisher: Springer | 4th edition (June 30, 2001) | ISBN: 0306462443 | Pages: 958 | PDF | 9.33 MB\n\nThe control of reactivity to achieve specific syntheses is one of the overarching goals of organic chemistry. In the decade since the publication of the third edition, major advances have been made in the development of efficient new methods, particularly catalytic processes, and in means for control of reaction stereochemistry.\n\nThis volume assumes a level of familiarity with structural and mechanistic concepts comparable to that in the companion volume, Part A, Structures and Mechanisms. Together, the two volumes are intended to provide the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in chemistry with a sufficient foundation to comprehend and use the research literature in organic chemistry.\nRead more at http://ebookee.org/Advanced-Organic-Chemistry-Fourth-Edition-Part-B-Reaction-and-Synthesis-by-Richard-J-Sundberg-Repost-_810804.html#8Zq9k3Vq2B9ds2XL.99\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI just posted the fifth edition of this book, but some reviewers have observed errors in the reaction mechanisms, and thus prefer the older fourth edition. I found this online on filedeposit.com using Google, so I didn't make this. It seems like a good idea to post this here before it gets taken down on there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af70a149dd35c9146375608740c1e9991389ccf","amp;dn":"Advanced+Organic+Chemistry%2C+Part+B+4e+%28older%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af70a149dd35c9146375608740c1e9991389ccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,247,10,20,157,211,92,145,70,55,86,8,116,12,30,153,145,56,156,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

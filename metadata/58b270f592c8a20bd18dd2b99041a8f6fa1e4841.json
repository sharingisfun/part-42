You may think oldies you may think country but some of these songs are popping and sound great. All people not living under rocks know the song &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; which is certainly the biggest hit, but Brenda Lee also recorded Break It To Me Gently, which was later remade by Juice Newton. Juice Newton? Who uploads Juice Newton I wonder? How Can I get a copy I wonder? Oh ye of little faith, search for Big Papi Juice Newton.  Oh, and check out the song Dum Dum and try to convince anyone the sound is not wayyyyy ahead of its time.  You can hear that guitar just wanting to break free and surf away.\n\nRead the review from Laycock below lol Big papi gonna change his name to Laycock!! lol\n\n- Big Papi\n\n[quote]By Barron Laycock\n\nThey once referred to Brenda Lee as Little Miss Dynamite because such big noises came out of such a little girl, but she sure wasted no time making her way to the top ten list. From her famous &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; to a soulful &quot;Emotions&quot; to &quot;All Alone Am I&quot;, she was the perfect female vocalist of the early sixties, sharing the limelight with Connie Francis, who also had a number of top ten hits in the same era. With &quot;Break It To Me Gently&quot;, &quot;Losing You&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Loves Me But You&quot;, she enjoyed a long string of consecutive hits. So, too, with &quot;I Want To Be Wanted&quot;, &quot;Sweet Nothings&quot;, &quot;Fool Number One&quot;, &quot;You Can Depend On Me&quot; and &quot;sweet Nothings&quot;, she guaranteed her place in popular music history. This is a great compilation of all her hits, and I am sure you will love listening to it again and again.

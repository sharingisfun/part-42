The fond appeal of Witmer's own songwriting, in combination with the shimmering instrumental work of Don Peris (the &quot;Innocence Mission&quot;) unfolds with airy simplicity. Unlike successive albums, Safe Away is minimally produced -- a close replication of a live acoustic performance, with touches of organ or guitar appearing almost as subconscious blushes of emotion, rather than anything to be focused on by the listener. Witmer proceeds through the set list with the confidence and generosity of a seasoned songwriter, despite the journal-like candor of his lyrics. As he opens his heart, Peris likewise opens volumes of space with his reverberant production style, setting Witmer on good footing for his first of several records on the Burnt Toast Vinyl label.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d7fed64c75dae10c9a8dd272331a5d596cbdde","amp;dn":"Denison+Witmer+-+Safe+Away+%5B1998%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d7fed64c75dae10c9a8dd272331a5d596cbdde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,215,254,214,76,117,218,225,12,154,141,210,114,51,26,93,89,108,189,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

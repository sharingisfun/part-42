The album was originally intended to be called Road to Paradise, but the death of Mushroom Records head Shelly Siegel in January 1979 made the collapse of the label, which had released each of Chilliwack's last three albums, all but certain. As a result, three of the longstanding band members left the group, leaving only Bill Henderson and Brian MacLeod from the prior lineup. Because of the label's financial problems, there were no real hits from the album.\n\nBill Henderson: guitar, vocals \nBrian MacLeod: guitar, vocals, drums, synthesizer, piano, vibes \nAb Bryant: bass \nJohn Roles: guitar, vocals \nBucky Berger: drums \n\nMy rip from vinyl.\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a570b9cc257b666d3058ff7e9686b7b9e4f266","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Breakdown+in+Paradise+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a570b9cc257b666d3058ff7e9686b7b9e4f266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,165,112,185,204,37,123,102,109,48,88,255,126,150,134,183,185,228,242,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

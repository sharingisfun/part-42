An unstable mixture of wizards, obsessives, melancholics, bores, musicians and warriors, they saw offÃ¢â‚¬â€through luck, guile and sheer mulishnessÃ¢â‚¬â€any number of rivals, until finally packing up in 1918. From their principal lairs along the Danube they ruled most of Central Europe and Germany and interfered everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€indeed the history of Europe hardly makes sense without them.\n\nDanubia, Simon WinderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilarious new book, plunges the reader into a maelstrom of alchemy, skeletons, jewels, bear-moats, unfortunate marriages and a guinea-pig village. Full of music, piracy, religion and fighting, it is the history of a strange dynasty, and the people they ruled, who spoke many different languages, lived in a vast range of landscapes, believed in rival gods and often showed a marked ingratitude towards their oddball ruler in Vienna. Readers who discovered Simon WinderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storytelling genius and infectious curiosity in Germania will be delighted by the eccentric and fascinating tale of the Habsburgs and their world.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | History | Travel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8df68c761434eaacb03aac6be5de21a07bd581","amp;dn":"Danubia%3A+A+Personal+History+of+Habsburg+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8df68c761434eaacb03aac6be5de21a07bd581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,141,246,140,118,20,52,234,172,176,58,172,107,229,222,33,160,123,213,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

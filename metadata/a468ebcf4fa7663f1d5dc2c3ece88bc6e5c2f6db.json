It completely changed how viewers saw the world, revealing wildlife and tribal communities that had never been filmed or even seen before.\r\n\r\nBroadcast ten years before colour television was seen in the UK, Zoo Quest was thought to have been filmed in black and white, until now. Using this extraordinary new-found colour film, together with new behind-the-scenes stories from David Attenborough and cameraman Charles Lagus, this special showcases the very best of Zoo Quest to West Africa, Zoo Quest to Guiana and Zoo Quest for a Dragon in stunning HD colour for the very first time.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 7470Kbps (Q~21)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 89 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 5.01 GB\r\nContainer: TS\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged\r\n\r\n720p/MKV also available at MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a468ebcf4fa7663f1d5dc2c3ece88bc6e5c2f6db","amp;dn":"BBC+David+Attenboroughs+Zoo+Quest+in+Colour+1080i+HDTV+h264-MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a468ebcf4fa7663f1d5dc2c3ece88bc6e5c2f6db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,104,235,207,79,167,102,63,29,93,194,195,236,232,139,198,229,194,246,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

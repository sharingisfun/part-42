With its regular symmetrical spiral structure, and its being not tilted too much and near enough to allow detailed studies of its stars, M33 is well-suited for the study of a typical spiral galaxy. \nIn this work, Paul Hodge places current research on M33 (and similar galaxies) in both historical and global perspectives. The book is written in a language accessible for specialists and non-specialists, for professional and amateur astronomers, for scientists and the curious public and, most importantly, for students.\n\n \nSeries: Astrophysics and Space Science Library (Book 379)\nHardcover: 150 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2012 edition (September 15, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9400720246\nISBN-13: 978-9400720244\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.

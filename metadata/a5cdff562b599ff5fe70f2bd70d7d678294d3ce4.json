The book provides detailed, practical instruction on the conservation and stabilisation of ruins by structural and non-structural means, as well as describing the procedures and conditions that need to be in place to ensure the protection of our important historic sites. In considering aspects of architectural conservation, archaeology and ecology together for the first time, this book provides an integrated, holistic view of this international topic that will be essential reading for those working in this field\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Conservation concepts 1\n2 Stability and survival 10\n3 Condition surveys of masonry ruins 44\n4 Philosophy, technology and craft 82\n5 Preventive conservation of ruins: reconstruction, reburial and enclosure 146\n6 The ecology of ruin sites 194\n7 Submerged ruins 212\n8 Implementing conservation works on ruins 234\n9 Interpretation and display of ruins and sites 246\n10 Case studies 264\nCase Study 1: Guildford Castle, UK 265\nCase Study 2: Masada, Israel 279\nCase Study 3: Gosport Railway Terminal, UK 296\nEpilogue 306\nAppendix 1 Materials and techniques 309\nAppendix 2 Structural interventions 319\nAppendix 3 Implementation of work Ã¢â‚¬â€œ personnel selection 331\nAppendix 4 Visitor perceptions (The Alamo, San Antonio, Texas) 332\nIndex 341","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5cdff562b599ff5fe70f2bd70d7d678294d3ce4","amp;dn":"Conservation+of+Ruins+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5cdff562b599ff5fe70f2bd70d7d678294d3ce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,205,255,86,43,89,159,245,254,112,242,189,112,215,214,120,41,77,60,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

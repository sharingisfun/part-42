This fascinating snapshot of life in the region's small towns and villages is Andrzej Klamt and Ulrich Rydzewski's captivating verite update of a vintage German &quot;mountain film,&quot; painting poetic portraits of the landscapes and personalities that make up this rural Eastern European intersection. Everyone gets to speak his piece, from street musicians and carnival magicians to the gypsies, rabbis, cowboys and others who populate the area's rustic hamlets. The harsh climate and hand-to-mouth daily living may not make this terra incognita a Shangri-La, but the quiet dignity and reserve of the people nips all maudlin sentimentality in the bud. &quot;For me, this isn't the middle of nowhere,&quot; one of the subjects proudly says, &quot;this is the place that I call home.&quot;\n\n******************************************************************************\nOriginal Title: Carpatia - Geschichten aus der Mitte Europas\nReleased: 2004\nEng.

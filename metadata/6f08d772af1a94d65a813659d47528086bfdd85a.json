The only problem is that she's not thin and beautiful like all her coworkers at Mode, the high-fashion magazine where she works. The only reason the publisher hired her to be his son's secretary, is that he thought Betty was someone who Daniel would never sleep with. Betty's hard work and determination earns Daniel's respect, as she helps him find his way through the shark infested waters of the fashion industry. Ugly Betty is based on a Colombian telenovela &quot;Yo Soy Betty La.\n\nDVDRiP from retail DVD.\n\nHave fun!\n\nMiGeR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f08d772af1a94d65a813659d47528086bfdd85a","amp;dn":"Ugly.Betty.S02.DVDRip.XviD-MiGeR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f08d772af1a94d65a813659d47528086bfdd85a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,8,215,114,175,26,148,214,90,129,54,89,212,117,40,8,107,253,216,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

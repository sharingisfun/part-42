We don't often get to see images of Chile, though its movies have become slightly more common since 1994. This is a well-told story with a serious theme about media exploitation.\n\nMy own copy is rather fuzzy; fortunately I found this much better one elsewhere on the net, and I am reseeding it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400efdbfb7a4a7e1810b8d92ce69779c6b4afeba","amp;dn":"Johnny+100+Pesos+%28Chile%2C+1994%29+Eng.Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400efdbfb7a4a7e1810b8d92ce69779c6b4afeba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,14,253,191,183,164,167,225,129,11,141,146,206,105,119,156,107,74,254,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

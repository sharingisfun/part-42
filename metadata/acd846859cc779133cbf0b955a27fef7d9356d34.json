Prior to the release of Foo Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums), and Pat Smear (guitar) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).\n\nChris Shiflett joined as the band's second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys.\n\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\nFoo Fighters (1995) \nThe Colour and the Shape (1997) \nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999) \nOne by One (2002) \nIn Your Honor (2005) \nEchoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace (2007) \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy y'all! :)\nand, seed.\n-rgh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd846859cc779133cbf0b955a27fef7d9356d34","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters+Discography+%281995-2007%29+%2B+Covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd846859cc779133cbf0b955a27fef7d9356d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,216,70,133,156,199,121,19,60,191,11,149,90,39,254,247,217,53,109,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

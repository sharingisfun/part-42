Rather than another book on the discipline of safety engineering, this is a thoroughly practical guide to the procedures and technology of safety in control and plant engineering. This highly practical book focuses on efficiently implementing and assessing hazard studies, designing and applying international safety practices and techniques, and ensuring high reliability in the safety and emergency shutdown of systems in your plant.\r\n\r\nThis book will provide the reader with the most up-to-date standards for and information on each stage of the safety life cycle from the initial evaluation of hazards through to the detailed engineering and maintenance of safety instrumented systems. It will help them develop the ability to plan hazard and risk assessment studies, then design and implement and operate the safety systems and maintain and evaluate them to ensure high reliability. Finally it will give the reader the knowledge to help prevent the massive devastation and destruction that can be caused by today's highly technical computer controlled industrial environments. \r\n\r\n* Helps readers develop the ability to plan hazard and risk assessment studies, then design, implement and operate the safety systems and maintain and evaluate them to ensure high reliability\r\n* Gives the reader the knowledge to help prevent the massive devastation that can be caused by today's highly technical computer controlled industrial environments\r\n* Rather than another book on the discipline of safety engineering, this is a thoroughly practical guide to the procedures and technology of safety in control and plant engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecd959e6f5323827653de46c245dc9d5e8a9cd4","amp;dn":"Practical+Industrial+Safety%2C+Risk+Assessment+and+Shutdown+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ecd959e6f5323827653de46c245dc9d5e8a9cd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,205,149,158,111,83,35,130,118,83,222,70,194,69,220,157,94,138,156,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

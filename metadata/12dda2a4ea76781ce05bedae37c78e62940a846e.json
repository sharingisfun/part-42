They began playing in Nashville and signed to INO Records, who released the band's debut album, 33Miles, in 2007. The album peaked at #8 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers albums chart and #16 on its Top Christian Albums chart.[1] In 2008, their next album One Life, proved to be the record that broke them big, landing at #4 on Billboard's Top Christian Albums chart and sneaking into the lower reaches of the Top 200. In 2009, they released their Christmas album, &quot;Believe&quot;. Their 2007 song &quot;There is a God&quot; was played as the wake-up call music for the Space Shuttle astronauts on their STS-128 mission on September 3, 2009. Pianist Colin Stoddard left the group in 2009 to become a pastor. In 2010, Barton and Lockwood continued on and released Today.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12dda2a4ea76781ce05bedae37c78e62940a846e","amp;dn":"33+Miles+Discography+2007-2010+%283+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12dda2a4ea76781ce05bedae37c78e62940a846e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,221,162,164,234,118,120,28,224,91,237,174,55,199,142,98,148,10,132,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

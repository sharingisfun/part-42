Big Mountain's pop-reggae style has earned them the title &quot;The American UB40.\n\n\nThe band was made up of Quino and James McWhinny, and John and Billy Stoll.\n\n\n                               Hit OF 1994\n\n\n                       ***Baby I Love Your Way.***\n\n\n                                 Enjoy!!!\n\n\n                             ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae82cd4c89fd208cb97923096c8e1577991db8d","amp;dn":"Big+Mountain+-+Baby+I+love+your+way%281994%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae82cd4c89fd208cb97923096c8e1577991db8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,232,44,212,200,159,210,8,203,151,146,48,150,200,225,87,121,145,219,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

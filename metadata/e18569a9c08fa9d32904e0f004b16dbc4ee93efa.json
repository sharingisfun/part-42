Bright cherry. Creamy vanilla.\nNatural sodas are vibrantly flavored with the zing of just-squeezed citrus juice, the sweetness of ripe berries, or the subtle perfume of fresh herbs. And with the popularity of countertop appliances that turn tap water into sparkling water, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier than ever to make the real thing in your own kitchen: simply mix a fresh soda syrup with bubbly water for a drink thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as sweet (or not) as you likeÃ¢â‚¬â€minus any artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.\nIn Make Your Own Soda, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find 70 recipes for all-natural syrups with unique, artisanal flavors like pineapple, lemongrass, and hibiscus, as well as old-time favorites like ginger, sarsaparilla, and grape. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find great ways to use homemade syrups to create soda fountain classics (Chocolate Egg Cream), great cocktails (Lovage Gin Fizz), and hot drinks (Hot Apple Spice Cup), all as delicious as they are distinctive.\n\nAbout the Author\nAnton Nocito is the founder of P&amp;H Soda Co., an all-natural soda syrup company located in Brooklyn, New York. Nocito is a graduate of the French Culinary Institute and was an executive sous chef within the Union Square Hospitality Group, as well as other restaurants in New York City and Long Island.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18569a9c08fa9d32904e0f004b16dbc4ee93efa","amp;dn":"Make+Your+Own+Soda+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18569a9c08fa9d32904e0f004b16dbc4ee93efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,133,105,169,192,143,169,211,41,4,224,240,4,177,109,188,78,233,62,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

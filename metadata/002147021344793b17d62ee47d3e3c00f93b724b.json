Released in the United States on March 9, 2010, the album boasts &quot;12 previously unreleased studio recordings,&quot; including the title track, &quot;one of the most sought after of all of Hendrix's commercially unavailable recordings.&quot; The tracks on Valleys of Neptune were largely self-produced by Hendrix, and received extra posthumous production from Janie Hendrix, Eddie Kramer and John McDermott for Experience Hendrix, L.L.C. Largely recorded in 1969 following the release of Electric Ladyland, the album predominantly features the original lineup of The Jimi Hendrix Experience: vocalist and guitarist Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell. The lead single released from the album was &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;, on February 1, 2010, followed by &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; on March 1; music videos were produced for both songs.\n\nThe majority of the tracks featured on Valleys of Neptune were recorded in early 1969, while Hendrix was experimenting with songs for his unfinished fourth album, following the successful release of Electric Ladyland in September 1968. Numerous different versions have been released, both officially and otherwise, and the majority of the 'previously unreleased' recordings present on the 2010 album have been released in one form or another before, albeit sometimes in inferior quality or different versions.

The title track, much craved by Hendrix devotees, delivers on the promise of the musician's legendary trove of unreleased material: a fully realized song written and recorded by Hendrix at his creative peak in 1969/70 that had remained unrecovered for nearly four decades. 'It is important that everyone understand that this is not the 'lost' album,' explains John McDermott, Experience Hendrix archivist, who wrote extensive liner notes for the release. 'It is the documentation of an important point in his career when the original JHE was making a follow up to 'Electric Ladyland' in 1969. Once Jimi started working with Billy Cox, he started making his creative transition and left this material on the shelf.'). eli.com\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nTrack Listing -\n1. Stone Free\n2.

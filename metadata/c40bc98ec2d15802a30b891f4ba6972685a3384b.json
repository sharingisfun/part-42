For those eager to have at least a front cover for each disc, the ones included could suffice. If there might be a creative mind amongst you, I would say, go for it!!\n\nOh, and in case anybody does have the real cover art, please upload it to Demonoid too!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past couple days, this unbootlegged material Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²ased on the descriptions given in Eight Arms To Hold You by Madinger and Easter, this is almost certainly sourced from a series of cassette tapes from the collection of Wings roadie Trevor Jones that were auctioned by Christie's in December of 1998. It was to compress them to FLAC (level 8 compression) and upload them here for your enjoyment.\n\nHere's a rough chronological tracklisting:\n\nSoily\nThis is from the August 1974 One Hand Clapping sessions with Geoff Britton on drums.\n\nBeware My Love (Instrumental, complete acetate version)\nBeware My Love (uncomplete version)\nMust Do Something About It (Paul on vocal)\nShe's My Baby (Take 1)\nShe's My Baby (version 2)\nSilly Love Songs (without strings or horns)\nThe Note You Never Wrote (without strings)\nTime To Hide (instrumental)\nWino Junko (rough mix)\n\nThese tracks date from the January-February 1976 Wings At The Speed Of Sound sessions.\n\nRichard Cory\nThis is a live in-studio rehearsal from September 1975 - more from this session has surfaced and will be seeded very soon.\n\nMull Of Kintyre (count-in)\nNot very different from the released version, recorded in August 1977.\n\nDaytime Nighttime Suffering (early version)\nDates from January-February 1979.\n\nTake It Away (monitor mix)\nWhat's That You're Doing (rough take)\n\nNewt Rack (instrumental)\nThese tracks are taken from the Tug Of War sessions at Air Studios in London and Montserrat in March 1981. Newt Rack was recorded on March 11, 1981 and is a slightly aimless instrumental with an appropriately whimsical throwaway title.\n\nChoba Medley (Part 1)\nChoba Medley (Part 2)\nThese two tracks contain excerpts from all the tracks recorded in the July 1987 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â° Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â  sessions. This includes interesting but frustratingly incomplete snippets from the unreleased versions of &quot;Cut Across Shorty,&quot; &quot;No Other Baby,&quot; &quot;Poor Boy,&quot; &quot;Lend Me Your Comb&quot; and &quot;Take This Hammer.&quot;\n\nAnd that's what's surfaced thus far. There may be more yet to come - Madinger and Easter mentioned the Trevor Jones collection including a tape from the Holly Days sessions. But even if this is all we get, it's still a major find. For me, Paul's version of &quot;Must Do Something About It&quot; alone is worth the price of admission - which is, of course, absolutely free.\n\nFirst of all, thanks to everyone who said thanks, seeded, and offered comments on the first torrent. However, that torrent was really just the tip of the iceberg - much more fascinating uncirculated material has surfaced from the same source, and again I've encoded them to FLAC and am uploading them here to spread this material freely. (That last word is important - there is news through the grapevine that this material is being pressed up by enterprising bootleggers. It might be inevitable, but it's still a shame that there are some trying to turn a profit from something offered so generously. That's all the soapboxing I'll be doing though.)\n\nAgain, I'll try to provide some background on these tracks through the information given in the file names, the mentions of the material in Madinger and Easter's wonderful book Eight Arms To Hold You, and I'll probably make a couple of educated guesses based on what the tracks themselves sound like.\n\nAnother Day\nHi Hi Hi\nBoth of these are taken from acetates, and don't sound notably different from the released versions.\n\nLittle Woman Love / C Moon\nYou Gave Me The Answer\nLive And Let Die (Part 2 working Session)\nThese tracks date from the early September 1975 Elstree Film Studio rehearsals for the Wings UK tour later that month. Madinger and Easter mention three cassettes in the Trevor Jones collection from this era, named &quot;1975 Tour Setlist,&quot; &quot;Tour Rehearsal 1975,&quot; and &quot;Day 2 Elstree, 1975.&quot; It's hard to tell which tracks are sourced from which, but it does seem (through the track labeling as well as the sonic quality) that there are 3 different sources for these tracks. This seems to be musically looser, so I am (very!) tentatively going to name this one &quot;Tour Rehearsal 1975.&quot;\n\nJunior's Farm (Version 1)\nJunior's Farm (Version 2)\nLet Em In (Take 1)\nLittle Woman Love / C Moon\nOld Man River\nSoily\nStealin\nSuicide\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Elstree rehearsals. Since Soily and Junior's Farm are more developed, I'll go out on a limb and dub this one &quot;Day 2 Elstree 1975.&quot; Let 'Em In wasn't performed during that tour, and this runthrough seems to be mostly to familiarize the band with the song's structure. Old Man River and Stealin' are loose jams, the latter of which is a song Denny was quite fond of - he also performed it during the October 1980 rehearsals on the When It Rains It Pours disc.\n\nSoily\nPicasso Last Words / Richard Cory\nBluebird\nI ve Just Seen A Face\nYesterday\nYou Gave Me The Answer\nMagneto And Titanium Man\nMedicine Jar\nGo Now\nLetting Go\nLive And Let Die\nCall Me Back Again (Incomplete)\nListen To What The Man Said\nHi Hi Hi\n\nFrom the track names, it's probably fair to assume two things: this is the &quot;1975 Tour Setlist&quot; tape and the rest of the tracks are probably out there somewhere.\n\nDid We Meet Somewhere Before\nFrom early 1978, not too different from what's been bootlegged before, although it might be a little cleaner than what's previously circulated.\nReception (Long Version)\n\nCage (Instrumental Backing Track)\nGetting Closer (Instrumental Backing Track)\nRockestra Theme So Glad To See You Here (Instrumentals)\n\nThese Back To The Egg outtakes could be sourced from the early 1979 rough assembly cassette Madinger and Easter mention. The track numbers given also hint that there may be more from this cassette yet to come.\n\nFabulous / Teddy Bear\nMadinger &amp; Easter report three cassettes labeled &quot;Wings Rehearsal 1980&quot; as part of the Trevor Jones collection, and that they may contain Fabulous and Teddy Bear, in addition to In The Midnight Hour, Tears Of A Clown, Ain't That A Shame, Oh Boy, I'm In Love Again, Your True Love, and Lend Me Your Comb. If this track is any indication, the rest of those covers are very rough jams.\n\nMomma's Little Girl (Intro)\nMomma's Little Girl\nTake It Away\nNo Values\nDenny's Song\n\nThese are also likely from a &quot;Wings Rehearsal 1980&quot; cassette. These all seem to be from Pugins Hall in Kent (the site of the aforementioned When It Rains It Pours boot), and seem to be rehearsals in earnest for a Wings album that never came to fruition. Take It Away has been dated as October 1980, while No Values is from November 7, 1980. Denny's Song was later attempted in Montserrat in February 1981 with Paul, Denny &amp; Dave Mattacks, but this version is a rough run-through with the rest of Wings. At the end of Take It Away, Denny reports a car accident up the road - are there any records of automobile incidents in Kent in 1980 to give this track a definite date? (Cheeky, I know.)\nThat's all I know of that has surfaced thus far, but keep your fingers crossed for more to appear - there's definitely more out there.\nUnfortunately, it seems as though all of the original uploaded files have been deleted fromso it seems that this is probably the last of the new material for now. My personal thanks to the original uploader for liberating this wonderful material and also to those who reposted these tracks and allowed for the full collection to be compiled.\n\nVenus And Mars / Rock Show / Jet\nLet Me Roll It\nSpirits Of Ancient Egypt\nBlackbird\nLady Madonna\nThe Long And Winding Road\nMy Love\nBand On The Run\n\nThese tracks belong to the previous set of September 1975 Wings rehearsals.\n\nA Love For You\nWaterspout\n\nThese two tracks probably are taken from the &quot;Cold Cuts, 1980&quot; cassette Madinger &amp; Easter mention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull 3CD Tracklist:\n\nSoily\nBeware My Love (Instrumental, complete acetate version)\nBeware My Love (uncomplete version)\nMust Do Something About It (Paul on vocal)\nSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Baby (Take 1)\nSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Baby (version 2)\nSilly Love Songs (without strings or horns)\nThe Note You Never Wrote (without strings)\nTime To Hide (instrumental)\nWino Junko (rough mix)\nRichard Cory\nMull Of Kintyre (count-in)\nDaytime Nighttime Suffering (early version)\nTake It Away (monitor mix)\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Doing (rough take)\nNewt Rack (instrumental)\nChoba Medley (Part 1)\nChoba Medley (Part 2)\nAnother Day\nHi Hi Hi\nLittle Woman Love / C Moon\nYou Gave Me The Answer\nLive And Let Die (Part 2 working Session)\nJuniorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Farm (Version 1)\nJuniorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Farm (Version 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Em In (Take 1)\nLittle Woman Love / C Moon\nOld Man River\nSoily\nStealin\nSuicide\nSoily\nPicasso Last Words / Richard Cory\nBluebird\nI ve Just Seen A Face\nYesterday\nYou Gave Me The Answer\nMagneto And Titanium Man\nMedicine Jar\nGo Now\nLetting Go\nLive And Let Die\nCall Me Back Again (Incomplete)\nListen To What The Man Said\nHi Hi Hi\nDid We Meet Somewhere Before\nReception (Long Version)\nCage (Instrumental Backing Track)\nGetting Closer (Instrumental Backing Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRockestra Theme So Glad To See You Here (Instrumentals)\nFabulous / Teddy Bear\nMommaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Little Girl (Intro)\nMommaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Little Girl\nTake It Away\nNo Values\nDennyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Song\nVenus And Mars / Rock Show / Jet\nLet Me Roll It\nSpirits Of Ancient Egypt\nBlackbird\nLady Madonna\nThe Long And Winding Road\nMy Love\nBand On The Run\nA Love For You\nWaterspout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; AS ALWAYS: REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c40bc98ec2d15802a30b891f4ba6972685a3384b","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%28and+Wings%29+-+Trevor+Jones+Tapes+1971+-+1987+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c40bc98ec2d15802a30b891f4ba6972685a3384b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,11,201,142,194,209,88,2,163,11,137,31,75,166,151,38,133,163,56,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

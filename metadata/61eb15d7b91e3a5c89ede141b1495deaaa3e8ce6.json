Just guitar, drums and voices, the Mystery Twins are like a cynical, co-ed Everly Brothers brandishing razor sharp songs that cut to the bone with the simplest of strokes. With such a long tenure as bandmates Lehmann and Brush have developed a preternatural sense of songcraft, a mastery of the streamlined and a push and pull delivery that not only makes them a phenomenal live show, but digs deep into your soul on record.\n\n&quot;Ghost in the Ground&quot;, partly recorded with engineer Joe Costa (Ben Folds Five, Brendan Benson) and co-producer Dexter Green (The Greenhornes, Derek Hoke) and partly recorded by Lehmann himself, manages to be mature and innocent in simultaneous strokes. There is a grandeur in their simplicity, a brashness in their beauty and a spool of contradictions spooling out from the album. From the headless vandalized statues of outsider-artist E.T. Wickham that adorn the cover to the final acoustic chords of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Long DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ghost in the Ground is a work of subtle charms and shining moments.

I did not mean for that to rhymeâ€ (Adam Mansbach)\r\n\r\nIn 2010, seven women met in Brooklyn, New York, to form a Mommy Group. Over coffee, croissants, wine, and the occasional baby carrot, they commiserated about typical new-mother issues: difficult births, babies who slept in ten-minute increments, and breast pumps that talked back in the middle of the night. And then things got complicated.\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Melissa suffered from postpartum depression and anxiety. Janeâ€™s daughter was diagnosed with developmental delays. Annaâ€™s husband left her when their baby was two weeks old. Through it all, the Mommy Group laughed, supported, and learned lessons from one another that the myriad â€œexpertsâ€ hadnâ€™t delivered.\r\n\r\nThe journalist of the bunchâ€”author Elizabeth Isadora Goldâ€”reached out to other Mommy Groups around the country and found that similar bonds were forming far beyond brownstone Brooklyn. In fact, mothers across all class, geographic, and racial boundaries appear to be searching for the same thing: a way to be strong, loving, engaged parents â€œwhile retainingâ€”or remakingâ€”our Selves.â€\r\n\r\nA witty, relatable, and honest look at the realities of parenthood today, The Mommy Group is a companion that will help any mom feel understood and empowered, and keep her laughing all the way","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68df75b6525a03c3bfa7dc1e0c716a45f7129a0a","amp;dn":"The+Mommy+Group+-+Elizabeth+Isadora+Gold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68df75b6525a03c3bfa7dc1e0c716a45f7129a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,223,117,182,82,90,3,195,191,167,220,30,12,113,106,69,247,18,154,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

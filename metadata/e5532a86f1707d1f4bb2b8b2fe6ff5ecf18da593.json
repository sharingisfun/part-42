They are listenable, but expect mediocre sound quality and some tape hiss.\n\nThe tracks are:\n\nSunday Morning Sunshine\nSniper\nAnd the Baby Never Cries\nBurning Herself\nBarefoot Boy\nBetter Place to Be\nCircle\nWoman Child\nWinter Song\n\nYet another tape from my 600+ collection about a third of which are pre-recorded while the rest were made from LPs borrowed from the public library and from family and friends. &quot;Why? WHY?&quot; you stammer, shocked and mystified beyond comprehension, horrified that anyone would be so stubborn about refusing to embrace the digital age. Well, here's the reason. I'm cheap, that's why. Replacing even half those tapes with CDs would cost around three grand. Ya gotta problem with that? You do? Yeah, well, if you weren't at least as cheap as I am, you wouldn't be looking for free downloads like this in the first place, suckah!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5532a86f1707d1f4bb2b8b2fe6ff5ecf18da593","amp;dn":"sniper+and+other+love+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5532a86f1707d1f4bb2b8b2fe6ff5ecf18da593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,83,42,134,241,112,125,31,75,178,184,178,254,111,245,236,241,141,165,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She Challenges all citizens to demand answers from congress about the  ... all Ã‚Â» legality of Federal Income taxes and the Federal Reserve. This is a 2 hour lecture about some of the inner secrets of the IRS, and the fundamental lack of juridical framework that supports it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1658315558785013776&amp;q=Sherry+Peel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1658315558785013776&amp;q=Sherry+Peel&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEx-IRS agent Sherry Peel Jackson lectures the public about the truth behind the Federal Reserve and income taxes. This documentary is a great educational tool.\n\nQUOTES FROM THIS DOCUMENTARY\n\n    ?For over 2 years now and on 4 separate occasions the We The People Foundation has sponsored meetings in Washington D.C. to try to bring together in one place various tax researchers from across the nation and IRS officers in order to discuss the alarming conclusions reached by the tax researchers that there is no bona fide law that required most Americans who live in the 50 states to file and pay the so called income tax.?\n\n    ?I?m not a former certified fraud examiner, I?m a certified fraud examiner. That?s something different than being at the IRS. I went and got..took the class and took the test and I am a certified fraud examiner and I am examining the biggest fraud this country has ever had.?\n\n    ??because the IRS never seizes anything. They get your employer. They get the tow truck company. They get others to do their dirty work. Those are the people that you need to educate. If they come and get your car you need to tell that tow truck driver ..excuse me what do you have here..this says that you?re supposed to take my vehicle. Is this valid? Have you researched whether this is valid, sir? I would suggest you do that because if you take my car away without knowing that you know that you know that this is valid I?m gonna sue you and your company..?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyrealitytv.com/sherry-peel-jackson-breaking-the-invisible-shackles-of-the-irs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyrealitytv.com/sherry-peel-jackson-breaking-the-invisible-shackles-of-the-irs/&lt;/a&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nGeneral #0 \nFormat : Google Video \nFormat/Info : Hack of AVI \nFormat/Family : RIFF \nFile size : 448 MiB \nPlayTime : 1h 41mn \nBit rate : 607 Kbps \n\nVideo #0 \nCodec : DivX \nCodec/Family : MPEG-4 \nCodec/Info : Mainly used by Google \nCodec settings/PacketBitStream : No \nCodec settings/BVOP : No \nCodec settings/QPel : No \nCodec settings/GMC : 0 \nCodec settings/Matrix : Default \nPlayTime : 1h 41mn \nBit rate : 466 Kbps \nWidth : 480 pixels \nHeight : 328 pixels \nAspect ratio : 1.463 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nChroma : 4:2:0 \nInterlacement : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.099 \nWriting library : Lavc50.1.0 \n\nAudio #0 \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 \nCodec profile : Joint stereo \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nBit rate mode : CBR \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nCoherency/PlayTime : 14625 \n\n===============================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3211187f7320f875d86b71815e55341aecc5fb63","amp;dn":"Sherry+Peel+Jackson+-+Breaking+the+Shackles+of+the+IRS+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3211187f7320f875d86b71815e55341aecc5fb63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,17,24,127,115,32,248,117,216,107,113,129,94,85,52,26,236,197,251,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

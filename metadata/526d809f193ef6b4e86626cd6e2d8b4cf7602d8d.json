I bought this disc in Bauru, Sao Paulo, Brazil in October 1982. While there, I was priviledged to attend a live concert at a University auditorium. The performance began in complete silence with &quot;Tarde Em Itapoan&quot;. Several bars into the performance I noticed a sound pervading the theatre, in perfect time, in perfect pitch, never detracting from the stage. When I looked for the sound I noticed that the audience was miming the words of the song. What I experienced was the active participation of the audience, the effect was electrifying.

Although the title may suggest, this was not a solo effort of Bob Markley, all songs were sung and played by Michael, Danny and Shaun.\nFeaturing Bob Markley, Danny Harris, and a finally credited Michael Lloyd the album released in 1970. This time Shaun Harris played a minor role, he sang only on Outside/Inside (a superior remake from 1969's Where's My Daddy?) .\nThis album is an excellent come-back, with beautiful orchestral arrangements by Lloyd\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b6813af8e20a33b8cb34255594a2fe9a1aecfd","amp;dn":"Markley+-+A+Group+%281969%2F2000%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b6813af8e20a33b8cb34255594a2fe9a1aecfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,182,129,58,248,226,10,51,184,203,52,37,85,148,162,254,154,26,236,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

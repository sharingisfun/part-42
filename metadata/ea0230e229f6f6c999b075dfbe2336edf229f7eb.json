However, students often find this one of the more difficult aspects. This book sets about correcting the problem, and it does so in a step by step fashion by using relevant examples, learning activities and highlighting key information. It encourages readers to think and evaluate written material for themselves, and not to take every piece of literature as Gospel.\n\nThe book is very well written and laid out. It uses plain English and relies on very little on jargon, therefore making it very readable.

It is about a London lawyer who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr Henry Jekyll, and the misanthropic Edward Hyde. The work is known for its vivid portrayal of the psychopathology of a split personality; in mainstream culture the very phrase &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; has come to mean a person who may show a distinctly different character, or profoundly different behaviour, from one situation to the next, as if almost another person, possibly because of the rare disorder &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; (more recently renamed &quot;Dissociative Identity Disorder&quot;).\n\nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was an immediate success and one of Stevenson's best-selling works. Stage adaptations began in Boston and London within a year of its publication and it has gone on to inspire scores of major film and stage performances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd01a04ee91a137f5be68b3fadaf9ca6d34302d","amp;dn":"The+Strange+Case+of+Dr+Jekyll+and+Mr+Hyde+by+Robert+Louis+Steven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd01a04ee91a137f5be68b3fadaf9ca6d34302d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,208,26,4,238,145,161,55,245,190,104,179,250,218,249,202,109,52,48,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

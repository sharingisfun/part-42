Keeping written lists of passwords on scraps of paper, or in a text document on your desktop is unsafe and is easily viewed by prying eyes (both cyber-based and human). Using the same password over and over again across a wide spectrum of systems and web sites creates the nightmare scenario where once someone has figured out one password, they have figured out all your passwords and now have access to every part of your life (system, e-mail, retail, financial, work).\n\nPassword Safe allows you to manage your old passwords and to easily and quickly generate, store, organize, retrieve, and use complex new passwords, using password policies that you control. Once stored, your user names and passwords are just a few clicks away.\n\nUsing Password Safe you can organize your passwords using your own customizable referencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for example, by user ID, category, web site, or location.\nYou can choose to store all your passwords in a single encrypted master password list (an encrypted password database), or use multiple databases to further organize your passwords (work and home, for example).\nAnd with its intuitive interface you will be up and running in minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cada181ec5b63f3a0f9d8d5eb7f5b7f7b46db485","amp;dn":"Password+Safe+3.16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cada181ec5b63f3a0f9d8d5eb7f5b7f7b46db485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,218,24,30,197,182,63,58,15,157,141,94,183,245,183,247,180,109,180,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

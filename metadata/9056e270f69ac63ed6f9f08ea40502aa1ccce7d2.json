This is not a text for the simple-minded; it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful, intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out -- and recognize -- the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living.&quot; \n- Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, editor of NaturalNews.com\n\n\n&quot;Well, here it is. The Formula. The Answer. The Way. A powerful book. Really remarkable.One formula. One answer. One way. There are others, of course. We all know that. There is more than one path to paradise. But this path is so simple. So practical. So easy. It allows us to come to a new understanding of sacredness without all the trappings of some other approaches - without years of study and meditation, without rituals to perform and masters to follow, without classes or workshops or seminars, without, well, much effort at all. Which is how it should be, it has always seemed to me. Truth should be a simple thing. \n\nSo here it is. The Simple Truth.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nAnd pass it on.&quot;\n- Neale Donald Walsch, New York Times best-selling author of the Conversations With God series.\n\n\n&quot;A thousand-page book in a hundred pages.&quot; (e-book is 41 pages ;-)\n- Joel Chudnow, Tampa, FL radio personality\n\n\n&quot;Seven Words That Can Change the World is wonderful in its simplicity and elegant in its message.&quot; \n- Nita Vallens, host of Innervision, KPFK Radio, Los Angeles, CA\n\n\n&quot;It is very daring. I think Joe is right on target for the third millennium.&quot; \n- Beverly Russell, Los Angeles, CA, writer\n\n\n&quot;An exquisite read. A gem.&quot;\n Jim Dreaver, Sebastopol, CA, author of The Way of Harmony\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9056e270f69ac63ed6f9f08ea40502aa1ccce7d2","amp;dn":"Joseph+R.+Simonetta+-+Seven+Words+that+can+Change+the+World.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9056e270f69ac63ed6f9f08ea40502aa1ccce7d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,86,226,112,246,154,198,62,214,249,240,142,164,5,2,170,28,204,231,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, Swift, Conrad, WildeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the roster of British writers who have made a lasting impact on literature is remarkable. More importantly, Britain's writers have long challenged readers with new ways of understanding an ever-changing world.\n\nThe 48 fascinating lectures in Classics of British Literature provide you with a rare opportunity to step beyond the surface of Britain's grand literary masterpieces and experience the times and conditions they came from and the diverse issues with which their writers grappled.\n\nBritish-born Professor John Sutherland, the Lord Northcliffe Professor Emeritus of Modern English at University College London and Visiting Professor of Literature at the California Institute of Technology, has spent a lifetime exploring these rich works. The unique insights he shares into how and why these works succeed as both literature and documents of Britain's social and political history can forever alter the way you experience a novel, poem, or play.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n1.\tAnglo-Saxon RootsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Pessimism and Comradeship\n2.\tChaucerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Social Diversity\n3.\tChaucerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A Man of Unusual Cultivation\n4.\tSpenserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Faerie Queene\n5.\tEarly DramaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Low Comedy and Religion\n6.\tMarloweÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Controversy and Danger\n7.\tShakespeare the ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Road to the Globe\n8.\tShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Mature Years\n9.\tShakespeare's RivalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jonson and Webster\n10.\tThe King James BibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½English Most Elegant\n11.\tThe MetaphysicalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Conceptual Daring\n12.\tParadise LostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A New Language for Poetry\n13.\tTurmoil Makes for Good Literature\n14.\tThe AugustansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Order, Decorum, and Wit\n15.\tSwiftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Anger and Satire\n16.\tJohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bringing Order to the Language\n17.\tDefoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Crusoe and the Rise of Capitalism\n18.\tBehnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Emancipation in the Restoration\n19.\tThe Golden Age of Fiction\n20.\tGibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Window into 18th-Century England\n21.\tEquianoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Inhumanity of Slavery\n22.\tWomen PoetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Minor Voice\n23.\tWollstonecraftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;First of a New Genus&quot;\n24.\tBlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mythic Universes and Poetry\n25.\tScott and BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Voices of Scotland\n26.\tLyrical BalladsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Collaborative Creation\n27.\tMad, Bad Byron\n28.\tKeatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Literary Gold\n29.\tFrankensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A Gothic Masterpiece\n30.\tMiss Austen and Mrs. Radcliffe\n31.\tPride and PrejudiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Moral Fiction\n32.\tDickensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Writer with a Mission\n33.\tThe 1840sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Growth of the Realistic Novel\n34.\tWuthering HeightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Emily's Masterwork\n35.\tJane Eyre and the Other BrontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«\n36.\tVoices of Victorian Poetry\n37.\tEliotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Fiction and Moral Reflection\n38.\tHardyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Life at Its Worst\n39.\tThe British BestsellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½An Overview\n40.\tHeart of DarknessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Heart of the Empire?\n41.\tWildeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Celebrity Author\n42.\tShaw and Pygmalion\n43.\tJoyce and YeatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Giants of Irish Literature\n44.\tGreat War, Great Poetry\n45.\tBloomsbury and the Bloomsberries\n46.\t20th-Century English PoetryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Two Traditions\n47.\tBritish Fiction from James to Rushdie\n48.\tNew Theatre, New Literary Worlds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d508d5e3b7e7e44f444bc19ce65428688ebd9f","amp;dn":"TTC+Classics+of+British+Literature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d508d5e3b7e7e44f444bc19ce65428688ebd9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,213,8,213,227,183,231,228,79,68,75,193,156,230,84,40,104,142,189,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

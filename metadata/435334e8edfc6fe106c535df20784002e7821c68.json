Soon after its formation, the companies organized into a regiment of foot known famously as the &quot;Black Watch,&quot; the name thought to derive from their dark-coloured tartans and their role to &quot;watch&quot; the Highlands. This book explores the uniforms, equipment and history of the Black Watch, from their involvement in the battles of Fontenoy and Ticonderoga in the mid-18th century, through to the Korean War of the 1950s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435334e8edfc6fe106c535df20784002e7821c68","amp;dn":"The+Black+Watch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435334e8edfc6fe106c535df20784002e7821c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,83,52,232,237,252,111,225,6,197,53,223,32,120,64,2,231,130,28,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

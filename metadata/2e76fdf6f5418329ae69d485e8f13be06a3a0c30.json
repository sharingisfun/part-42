Its world premiere was in Prague on 13 October 1995.\n\nSingers:\n\nJiri Korn\nLucie Bila\nDaniel Hulka\nRichard Genzer\nand others\n\nThe Story\n\n16th Century:\n\nThe story begins with farmers who seek protection in a monastery. They are running from Count Dracula's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack KnightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and Dracula himself. The priest tells them not to worry, that Dracula wouldn't dare to touch a monastery. A younger man disagrees, doubting Dracula's values.\n\nThe priest scolds him for not having faith in the power of Christ. Dracula, of course, doesn't mind the fact it's a monastery, robs it, and orders his Knights to kill them all.\n\nThe younger man tries to stop him and protests Dracula's actions. But Dracula kills him without a second thought. The priest is furious and curses Dracula, that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEven if he prays for death, he will never receive it, not even by his own hand. And his lips, reddened by bloodshed, will now thirst only for that same blood,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nIn the meantime, the Countess Adriana, Dracula's pregnant wife and love, is sad about not seeing her Count, and asks the court jester to take her mind off of it and cheer her up. He does so, by pointing out a butterfly in the castle, saying that it's a terrible &quot;intruder&quot;.\n\nThen, Adriana and Dracula sing the most famous song of the musical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVim ze jsi se mnouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, where they express their love for one another, saying that even with the great distance, nothing changes. They say that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe first flame, the first days of hope, the first touches of bonding,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will be in them forever.\n\nDracula comes home, satisfied with his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmissionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. For a while he jokes around with the jester, saying that his task in life is to &quot;clean the earth from all the unworthy filth&quot;. When he arrives to Adriana, she is dying from complications in labor.\n\nWhen Dracula learns that their newborn son is also dead, he is furious with the midwives. He then shouts at them why they didn't get the doctor.\n\nThe jester, who despises his master, answers that he had run to get the doctor, but the doctor wasn't there, because he was at the monastery Dracula had attacked. This infuriates Dracula past all thought. He orders the knights to put the jester in the stocks, to have a &quot;long, cruel&quot; night. He then yells at the rest to disappear from his line of sight.\n\nOnce he is left alone, he prays for Adriana to wake again. When that obviously does not happen, he blames God for her death. After some accusations shouted at God, he tries to commit a suicide. But no matter how many times he tries, his wounds instantly heal without scarring. This is where he learns that the curse from the priest is very much real; he is immortal.\n\nInstantly euphoric, he throws a huge celebration and calls back his jester, so that everyone is merry. But then he learns the second part of the curse, when he accidentally sucks all the blood from a young village girl, to the horror of everyone else.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‹â€ 19th Century\n\nDracula is living in his castle with three ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnymphsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (who eternally love him), his servants, and the main servant (played by the same man as the jester).\n\nHe is depressed with the immortality and still thinks of no one but Adriana.\n\nBut then, a young girl, Lorraine, his poor and orphaned relative, seeking refuge before her father's will is solved by lawyers, comes to his castle.\n\nShe is first afraid of the castle, and all the woods around it. But once she meets Dracula, she intends to stay. They agree on meeting in the garden next day.\n\nThe three nymphs, jealous, try to persuade Dracula to behave as he normally would, and drain her blood out. Dracula resists and hopes that with this new-found love, his curse will be lifted.\n\nThe voice of the priest reminds him that that is not to be. Dracula does not come next day to the meeting, and instead sends his servant with a necklace and an invitation to a ball.\n\nAt first, Lorraine is angry that the Count did not come, but in the end accepts the gift.\n\nIn the meantime, Lorraine's brother, young abbot Steven, comes to the castle to look for his sister. He suspects Dracula of being behind the murders of girls and women in the land.\n\nBefore the ball, everybody who is invited is wondering why there is a ball, when it is the wrong season for such events. They try to pry the information out of the servant, but he does not give them any.\n\nTheir bickering is interrupted, by the arrival of Dracula himself with Lorraine on his arm, wearing his necklace. After a while they both disappear, probably to Dracula's bedroom. Other ballguests hide behind their masks that they are also vampires and other beasts.\n\nThe ball alters to an orgy.\n\nShocked Steven watches it and is dragged into their dance. The servant saves him from being killed and then wonders out loud if he should finish him off or help him. He also speaks of the relationships between masters and their servants. In the end, he lets Steven live, but keeps him prisoner.\n\nLorraine then sings the famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJsi mÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¯j pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, where she describes how Dracula is the only thing important in her life now. She has completely and hopelessly fallen for him.\n\nA few days later, Dracula and Steven meet. Steven is angry that he was kept a prisoner and wants to take his sister away. Lorraine comes and assures him that she is happy with the Count. Steven tries to kill Dracula, but the wound instantly heals. Once they have learned of the immortality, Steven kills himself out of desperation.\n\nNow aware of what the Count really is, Lorraine begs him to also make her a vampire, saying that there is no point in her life without him. Unhappily, he complies.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‹â€ Present time\n\nFirst we meet the Stockers, a motor gang whose leader is Nick and his girlfriend Sandra. Sandra looks very similar to Adriana (and is played by the same woman). Nick promises her that their last heist will be looking at a casino, which is owned by Dracula.\n\nDracula, in these days, has a trusted Professor interested in his case, who helps him monitor his health.\n\nLorraine is becoming an alcoholic, and slowly realizes that Dracula cares for her less and less. She persuades the Professor to take her to his lab, where she has been denied entrance by Dracula. They go to the lab, but are (unknowingly) preceded by Nick, who takes a photo of AdrianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s painting and runs away.\n\nWhen Lorraine sees AdrianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s portrait she loses all interest in the machine and realizes that it's possible that Dracula loves someone else. The nymphs and other workers of the casino delighteedly watch the growing problems between Dracula and Lorraine.\n\nNick bought (or stole) exactly the same dress that Adriana had on in her portrait, for Sandra. When they go to the casino, and Sandra is wearing the dress, Dracula thinks that Adriana has returned and is instantly smitten, forgetting all about Lorraine.\n\nLorraine makes a jealous scene, but Dracula tells her that Adrianna is &quot;my eternal love, and with her, I have no need for you!&quot; After Dracula's words, Lorraine understands that her sacrifice was in vain.\n\nSandra, who has had enough of trying to be sexy for men that treat her with no respect (like Nick), is charmed by Dracula's sweet and sincere words, and decides to meet with him.\n\nDracula once again expresses his love for her. Sanda tries to explain the truth to him, but Nick interrupts them and takes Sandra away. Dracula is furious and chases after them. When other Stockers on motorbikes come, the Professor puts himself in front of the Count to save Dracula's life and loses his.\n\nDracula, with every precious shattered, and nothing left to him but pain, is finally allowed to die. He has to have a final judgement, with all those whom he has hurt. This goes from the priest, the village girl, Lorraine, Sandra, everyone. The characters accuse him of how much he hurt them, and Sandra has her chance to explain that she is not Adrianna.\n\nLorraine, knowing there is nothing left here for her, decides to join him in death and they both, reconciled, descend to Hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e76fdf6f5418329ae69d485e8f13be06a3a0c30","amp;dn":"Dracula+%5B1995%5D+Czech+Musical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e76fdf6f5418329ae69d485e8f13be06a3a0c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,118,253,246,245,65,131,41,174,105,212,133,232,241,59,224,106,58,12,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The double-CD compilation, fittingly dubbed The Man in Black, at least allows for some deeper exploration (although it lacks any liner notes whatsoever), while the outstanding three-disc Essential box truly allows you to sink your teeth into this legendary figure. Still, the songs that comprise 16 Biggest Hits do provide a telling snapshot of Cash&amp;#039;s substance and style--honest, straightforward, direct music devoid of ulterior motives and delivered with conviction.\n \n \n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?

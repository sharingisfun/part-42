Installation is basically unpacking the RAR file and clicking .exe. There is some waiting time the first time you load it.\n2. Don&amp;#039;t forget that this is a pre-alpha tech demo from 2003: the combat is pretty much unimplemented (sucky realtime only), the graphics are really basic. Also, most people will want to change the resolution, which can be done after the first time you run it. See instructions here\n3. The file is a whopping 241 MB, but don&amp;#039;t be disappointed that it doesn&amp;#039;t offer a full night&amp;#039;s worth of gameplay (though in true Fallout style, it offers a lot of different paths to victory).\n4. Also in true Fallout style, the demo is very, very buggy. Expect frequent crashes.\n\nSince this is probably the last time we will be posting on Van Buren, let me take this opportunity to send out a thank-you to the Van Buren staff and everyone who ever worked for Black Isle Studios. Gentlemen (and ladies); it was an honour and a privilege to watch you work and a pleasure to play your games. We salute you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c07262ac361e06809a288d4eb9572f4dd90030aa","amp;dn":"Fallout3%28Van+Buren%29Tech+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c07262ac361e06809a288d4eb9572f4dd90030aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,114,98,172,54,30,6,128,154,40,141,78,185,87,47,77,217,0,48,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

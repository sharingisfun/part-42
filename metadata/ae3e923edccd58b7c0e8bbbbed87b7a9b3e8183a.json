The movie Inexchange was corrupted on my disk and is not included.\n\nI'm not going to lie there are a lot of bad movies here but there are enough good ones for me to want to share this anyway. I recommend waiting tell its dark out then get really baked and sifting through tell you find a good one to watch. The video and sound is not so good on a lot of these but they came that way because these movies all had low budgets and some where copied over from VHS. \n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Enjoy and Seed!\nÃ‚Â \nÃ‚Â PS I have the Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares if anybody wanted me to upload it too. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae3e923edccd58b7c0e8bbbbed87b7a9b3e8183a","amp;dn":"Tomb+of+terrors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae3e923edccd58b7c0e8bbbbed87b7a9b3e8183a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,62,146,62,220,205,88,183,192,232,187,187,237,135,183,169,179,232,24,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

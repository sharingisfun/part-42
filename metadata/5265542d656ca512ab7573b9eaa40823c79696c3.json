State-of-the-art compiler\ntechnologies found in PVF include vectorization,\nparallelization, interprocedural analysis, memory hierarchy\noptimization, cross file function inlining, CPU-specific\noptimization and more. PGI Unified Binary? technology\nstreamlines cross-platform support by combining into a\nsingle executable file code optimized for any number of\ndifferent x64 processors.\n\nPVF augments the Visual Studio debugger by adding a Fortran\nlanguage specific custom debug engine. The PVF debug engine\nsupports debugging of single and multi-thread, OpenMP,\nmulti-thread MSMPI and hybrid MSMPIOpenMP Fortran\napplications. It enables debugging of 64-bit or 32-bit\napplications using source code or assembly code, and\nprovides full access to the registers and hardware state of\nthe processors. Other multi-process MSMPI capabilities\ninclude Visual Studio property pages for configuring\ncompile-time options, launching applications either locally\non a workstation or on a distributed-memory Windows HPC\nServer 2008 cluster system, and debugging of programs\nrunning either locally or on a cluster.\n\nVisual Studio Integration\nPVF includes features to enable rapid code development. PVF\nadds syntax coloring, Fortran intrinsics tips and keyword\ncompletion to the Visual Studio editor. PVF includes a\ncomplete Fortran build environment for Visual Studio with\nFortran specific features such as automatic build\ndependency management. PVF is interoperable with Microsoft\nVisual C so Fortran sub-programs can call C functions and\nvice versa. PVF includes a number of DVF/CVF compatibility\nfeatures including full support for the Win32 API. Sample\nprojects include building Fortran dialog boxes, console and\nWindows applications, DLLs and static libraries.\n\nPVF augments the Visual Studio debugger with a custom debug\nengine that provides Fortran language specific debugging\ncapability. The PVF debug engine supports debugging of\nsingle-thread, multi-thread, and OpenMP applications. It\nenables debugging of 64-bit or 32-bit applications using\nsource code or assembly code, and it provides full access\nto the registers and hardware state of the processor. The\nPVF debug engine can debug executable files built for\nnative Windows, Windows Subsystem for UNIX-based\nApplications (SUA) and Windows Services for UNIX (SFU). The\nPVF debug engine is interoperable with the Visual C.\n\nI N S T A L L\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) Place keyfile in program/game directory.\n3) Enjoy this release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5265542d656ca512ab7573b9eaa40823c79696c3","amp;dn":"PGI.Visual.Fortran.2010.v11.6.with.VS2010.Shell.X64-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5265542d656ca512ab7573b9eaa40823c79696c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,101,84,45,101,108,165,18,171,117,115,185,234,164,8,35,199,150,150,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

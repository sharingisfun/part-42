Webster (WSP, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nNanotechnology is an emerging and exciting area in the field of implants. Numerous promising developments have been elucidated regarding the use of nanotechnology to regenerate tissues. This important book highlights the potential of nanophase materials to improve hard and soft tissue applications. In all cases, increased tissue regeneration has been observed for bone, cartilage, vascular, bladder, and central/peripheral nervous system tissues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb109691e2078f8becfab54c1b9882607ec84a9","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+for+the+Regeneration+of+Hard+and+Soft+Tissues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb109691e2078f8becfab54c1b9882607ec84a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,177,9,105,30,32,120,248,190,207,171,84,193,185,136,38,7,236,132,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

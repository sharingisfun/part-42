Chevalier, trans.)- Man's Fate (Modern Library, 1961). 338 pages.\n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nAs explosive and immediate today as when it was originally published in 1933, Man's Fate (La Condition Humaine), an account of a crucial episode in the early days of the Chinese Revolution, foreshadows the contemporary world and brings to life the profound meaning of the revolutionary impulse for the individuals involved. As a study of conspiracy and conspirators, of men caught in the desperate clash of ideologies, betrayal, expediency, and free will, Andre Malraux's novel remains unequaled.\n\nReview\n\nMan's Fate was first published in 1933. As a fictional account of the early days of the Chinese Revolution, this novel remains a powerful expression of psychological insight into the spirit of political revolution. From the opening scene, in which Chinese terrorist Ch'en Ta Erh struggles internally over his task of assassinating a sleeping man, Malraux combines gritty action with an elaboration of the existential principle that social change is powered by the actions of individuals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd75254b9bb9817ecb06cb7ee1bb906b4beceafa","amp;dn":"Andre+Malraux+-+Man%27s+Fate+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd75254b9bb9817ecb06cb7ee1bb906b4beceafa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,117,37,75,155,185,129,126,203,6,203,126,225,187,144,107,75,236,234,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

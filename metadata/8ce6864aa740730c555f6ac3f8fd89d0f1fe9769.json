Its builders definitely did not intend the tower to lean, and they must have got a shock when the rising structure started to tilt. Yet, as it turned out, it was this defect that made the tower of Pisa a renowned monument.\r\nThe story is different for the Capital Gate in Abu Dhabi, which was originally designed to be inclined, and to look like a replica of the leaning tower of Pisa. The world has many such structures, which make an impression with their size, beauty, historic significance, or all of them combined.\r\nThis issue of Tell Me Why will tell you the tales behind some such mesmerising buildings.\r\n \nhttp://s12.postimg.org/4g4jszrod/Man_Made_Marvels_Tell_Me_Why_112.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce6864aa740730c555f6ac3f8fd89d0f1fe9769","amp;dn":"Man-Made+Marvels+%28Tell+Me+Why+%23112%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce6864aa740730c555f6ac3f8fd89d0f1fe9769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,230,134,74,167,64,115,12,85,95,106,195,248,253,137,208,241,254,151,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

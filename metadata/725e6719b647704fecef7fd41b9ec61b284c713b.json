This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere is an audio history of music from East L. A.\nCasey answers the question, &quot;In the rock era, what foreign artists from non-English speaking countries have been the most successful on the American charts?&quot;\nCasey also takes a few minutes to explain rap slang.\nThis chart is the first time in history that a singer has a song in the top 10 while there is another song in the top 10 about him.\nCasey tells the story of one artist who is in this countdown and refused to work with Prince when he had the chance.\nThis coundown contains two songs originally performed by Tommy James and The Shondells.\nCasey tells the story of the song that went to number 2, while the record label gave credit to a man who didn't sing it.\nAnd finally, the incomparable Whitney Houston spends a second week at number one.\n\n40:    Brilliant Disguise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bruce Springsteen\n39:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Look Down Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Sequel\n38:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been In Love Before Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cutting Crew        \n37:    Who Found Who - Jellybean     \n36:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Make Me Wait For Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny G.     \n35:    Where The Streets Have No Name Ã¢â‚¬â€œ U2    \n34:    Something Real (Inside Me/Inside You) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mr. Mister\n33:    I Need Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ L.L.

Edit your video. Share with the world.\n\nGet your video on the web with Telestream ScreenFlow award-winning screen recording and video editing software. With ScreenFlow you can record the contents of your entire computer screen while also capturing your video camera, microphone and (with optional components) your computer audio. The easy-to-use editing interface lets you creatively edit your video; add additional images, text, or music; and add transitions for a truly professional-looking video. The finished result is an MPEG-4 or QuickTime movie, ready for publishing to your Web site, blog or directly to YouTube, Vimeo. Google Drive, Dropbox or Facebook. \n\nUse ScreenFlow to create high-quality software demos, tutorials, app demos, training, presentations and more! \n\nHighest quality screen recording\n\nRetina display? No problem. Our efficient algorithm enables full-screen, 2880 x 1800-resolution screen capture with brilliant detail, while keeping file sizes low.\n\nPowerful video editing\n\nEasily add images, text, audio, video transitions and more to create professional-looking videos. Nested clips, closed captioning, chroma key, mouse callouts, annotations, video and audio filters, and freehand callouts are just a few of the touches that make ScreenFlow editing easy and powerful.\n\nIntuitive User Interface\n\nEvery so often design and function combine to form an elegant piece of software thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy and fun to use. ScreenFlow makes editing video easy, so users can focus on creatively telling their story.\n\nSuperior Export Quality &amp; Speed\n\nScreenFlow uses the popular x264 codec for significantly increased quality of H.264 exports. x264 encoding in ScreenFlow also offers significantly faster encoding. ScreenFlow 4.0 runs as a fully 64-bit application, which improves overall performance, memory usage, export speed, and scalability.\n\nExpanded publishing options let you easily publish your video to YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive, Dropbox or Facebook in just a few clicks.\n\n\n*please note: there are a few differences in this Mac App Store version and the version we sell on our Telestream store. Click this link and go to ScreenFlow FAQs to read about these differences: http://www.telestream.net/telestream-support/screen-flow/faq.htm#1d\n\n\n\n## Note: To be able to access offline activation you *MUST* block\nstore.esellerate.net in some manner. Going offline to register\nisn't enough because the application will sometimes attempt to\ncheck on launch. Other connections besides store.esellerate.net\nare ok to let through for now however that may change in the\nfuture\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3f8a1daf5d1e4f88bc1c8a475c931f2fbe8a4f","amp;dn":"ScreenFlow+4.5.3++%5BSERIAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3f8a1daf5d1e4f88bc1c8a475c931f2fbe8a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,63,138,29,175,93,30,79,136,188,28,138,71,92,147,31,47,190,138,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

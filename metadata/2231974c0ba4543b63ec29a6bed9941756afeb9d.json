It is very interesting to note that the Greek word that is translated as nation is &quot;ethnos&quot; which deals with ethnic background and race. Most of the wars and conflicts in the 1980's and 1990's are wars among ethnic groups and tribes.\nKingdom will rise against kingdom\nFamines\nEarthquakes are like the early pangs of childbirth. As the time grows nearer and nearer to His coming, the frequency and intensity of these five signs will increase.\nThe followers of Jesus will be handed over to be persecuted and killed. This is happening with more frequency in the Muslim controlled nations in the Middle East, and in Africa where Black Muslims are enslaving Black Christians.\nChristians will be hated by all nations on account of His name. In many parts of the world, Christians are jailed and killed for their beliefs; in the United States those who are Christians are hated by the media and liberals, and are known by the code words &quot;religious right.&quot;\nMany will fall away...that is, many who claimed to be Christians will recant their faith, and betray and hate Christians.\nMany false prophets will arise and deceive many.\nDue to excessive lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2231974c0ba4543b63ec29a6bed9941756afeb9d","amp;dn":"Marriage+Supper+Of+The+Lamb++-++by+Susan+Davis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2231974c0ba4543b63ec29a6bed9941756afeb9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,49,151,76,11,164,84,59,99,236,41,166,190,217,148,23,86,175,235,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

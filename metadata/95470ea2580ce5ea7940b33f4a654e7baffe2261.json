During the day he hangs out with the daughter of a family friend. They visit the usual sights but also coffee shops and flea markets off the beaten track. At one of these markets Alex spots an ancient-looking mask. Before he knows what he's doing he buys it. Later, in his hotel room, he feels compelled to put the mask on. Alex is sucked into a parallel Amsterdam, one from centuries before which begins to reveal the dark past of both the building he is staying in and the little girl who once lived there ...edging stealthily towards the terrible twist.\nGenre: Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95470ea2580ce5ea7940b33f4a654e7baffe2261","amp;dn":"Chris+Priestley+-+Through+Dead+Eyes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95470ea2580ce5ea7940b33f4a654e7baffe2261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,71,14,162,88,12,229,234,121,64,179,63,74,101,78,123,175,254,34,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

They seek retributionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦vengeanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to warn. Among the living, few intuit their presence.\n\nKatie O'Hara is one who can.\n\nAs she's drawn deeper and deeper into a gruesome years-old murder, whispered warnings from a spectral friend become more and more insistent. But Katie must uncover the truth: could David Beckett really be guilty of his fiancÃƒÂ©e's murder?\n\nWorseÃ¢â‚¬â€the body count's rising on the Island of Bones, andthe dead seem to be reenacting some macabre tableaux from history. The danger is increasing by the momentÃ¢â‚¬â€especially as Katie finds herself irresistibly drawn to David, who may be responsible for more than just one killingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nGhost Night\nA slasher movie turns real when two young actors are brutally murdered on a remote island film set. Their severed heads and arms are posed in macabre homage to a nineteenth-century pirate massacre.\n\nTwo years later, survivor Vanessa Loren is drawn back to South Bimini by a documentary being made about the storied region. Filmmaker Sean O'Hara aches to see how the unsolved crime haunts herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and Sean knows more than a little about ghosts.\n\nLured by visions of a spectral figurehead, Vanessa discovers authentic pirate treasures that only deepen the mystery. Are the murders the work of modern-day marauders, the Bermuda Triangle or a deadly paranormal echo of the island's violent history? As Vanessa and Sean grow closer, the killer prepares to resume the slaughterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦unless the dead can intervene.\n\nGhost Moon\nReclusive collector Cutter Merlin is seldom seen in Key WestÃ¢â‚¬â€lately, not at all. Officer Liam Beckett visits Merlin's curious house and discovers the gentleman in his study. In his death grip: a volume of occult lore and a reliquary. His eyes are wide with fright, his mouth a horrified rictus where spiders now dwell.\n\nKelsey Donovan returns to the old house to catalog her estranged grandfather's collection of artifacts and antiquities, vowing to see his treasures divested properly. But she cannot ignore the sense that she's being watched, the reports of malevolent black figures, the pervasive smell of death.\n\nIs the Merlin house haunted, even cursed? Liam knows well that some ghost stories are true and he swears to protect Kelsey. But there are forces at work for whom one more life is a pittance to pay for their deepest desireÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f8ea4273ae4475a783bba0dee3046816774b87","amp;dn":"Heather+Graham+-+Bone+Island+Trilogy+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f8ea4273ae4475a783bba0dee3046816774b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,248,234,66,115,174,68,117,167,131,187,160,222,227,4,104,22,119,75,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Its main goal is looking for balance, light, novelty, truth, sensation depth, i.e. creation of the HONEST art through looking for depth inside, creating ones own world, interrelating and interconnecting all the universal things into the whole.\n\nThe term &quot;holistic&quot; nowadays is used on various meanings, sometimes not exact, however it is the best to define namely the creative process and the art itself. Art and creation may be treated as holistic only when it becomes a reflection of an individual - creator with urgency and identity being an indispensable condition. \n\nEvery moment today&amp;#039;s life is rendering us something new - more, brighter, quicker, louder, however rare suggesting the DEEPER. For how far we enter the sensory overload before almost everything starts meaning less? There is a single direction, leading us into originality and the true self-disclosure - this is the voice of the soul, the core mystery of the artist&amp;#039;s own existence. \n  \n\nArtistic director ot the treatre\nZita Vilutyte  \n   \n\nVery important it is to search for creation impulses in the nature, to perceive them and to see their reflections inside, to look for the sources and depth for each artist - Creator, turning back to the true cause of spiritual experience, turning the whole art back to its sources, when it was used as the means for expression of the life mysteries. Also to experience the greatest mystery in the world - to disclose WHO WE ARE.\n Holistic art may be described as the art of &quot;movement&quot; - not in the general sense, but looking broader, i.e. for how urgent is the art to its creator at this moment, now, and for how much does it disclose and grow self-consciousness and perception during the creative process.\n\nTheatre of movement, dance, playing, singing without words, drawing and painting - these are the art spheres, enabling creator to disclose himself /herself best. There are no boundaries; movement enables disclosure of deeper and deeper soul strata \n One of the most important criteria is the motivation of the creator, i.e. author&amp;#039;s self-expression authenticity, integrity, chance to express the original feeling, disclosed by the author through his/her experiences, showing the author&amp;#039;s level of mastership.\n\nSuch creation offers nothing to hide behind - there is no clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, no action neither process, provided in advance - there is improvisation and spontaneity. No sphere plays a role - theatre, music, dance, and painting - creator is working in which ,we combine a number of art spheres. MOVEMENT towards the HONEST art is above all. \n \n*\n\nHolistic theatre of movement &quot;S&quot; is a creative process. Each action arises from the need to look for the answers to the questions and from the desire to reveal the greatest secrets of life, which are hiding in each of us. \n\nA spectator and a creator are inseparable parts of such a creative process, participants of the process experiencing transformation in its course.\n\nMetaphors are the components of this process. It describes without any explanation, just repeating the life. It is like creation of an endless ornament. From the centre to the unknown and always new spaces which in interaction draw the only and unique image.\n\nMetaphors are our experience. We perceive the environment through the interchange of information, events and energy. With the help of metaphor we can join the known and the unknown, to come nearer to inexhaustible potentiality of creation, to feel the laws of the Universe and harmony in the process of creation. When creator becomes a part of the process he changes in accordance with the laws of the Universe. In the dance of vibrations and colours the interacting ornaments join into the undivided volatile whole. \n Despite the context in which the process of creation exists our consciousness can join it with something jet not experienced. This is a synergetic process during which the intuition creates new combinations and metaforms - ideas, conceptions, objects, notions and processes thanks to which a new way of solution is found. If something is lost in the form it can be found in the process. Process is a movement; it is a creation course to the new quality forming some more subtle and perfect ornament.\n\nEach performance is like an ornament. The more details - the more shades, vibrations, and music. The growth of that ornament depends on the creator&amp;#039;s mastership, on his ability to see the detail&amp;#039;s reflection in the lots of spheres and to keep up the centre and to be able to transfer it to any new reference point.\n\nThus creation is not only the product of unrestrained chaotic freedom. It is the synthesis of freedom and discipline, the ability to join Heaven and Earth and through this narrow horizon to move to the aim.\n\n\n                                         Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ \n \n*\n\nCreative team:\n\nAlina Satkauskaite\n    Monika GumbakytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n       Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½ivile GulbinaitÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n           Ieva SaunoriutÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n              Deividas KarÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾inauskas\n                  Irmina Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½ilinskaitÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n                    EglÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ KulbokaitÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n                        KamilÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ StapuÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡aitytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n                          Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n                            KÃƒâ€žÃ¢â€žÂ¢stas VÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾eviÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ius \n\n*\n\nHolistic theatre of movement &quot;S&quot;\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;097a7f6863666273497a7965607c7a27657d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n \n*\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE OF THE PROJECT:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.heavencorn.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.heavencorn.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n&quot;Jug (Ãƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Å¾sotis)&quot;\nMusic by Zita Vilutyte\n(2006; mp3; VBR; avg. 192kb-s; NO VIDEO; 38:51)\n\nTHEY COME FROM THE SILENCE\nAND SINGING IN SILENCE \nLAUNDER LINENÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nAND THEN DRY THEM IN THE SUNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nTHEY FILL IN THE JUGS WITH CLEAR WATERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nTHE COMPLETENESS REFLECTING IN THEM\nSHINES IN THE ENDLESS SKYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nMusic, setting - Zita Vilutyte \nVideo - Tomas Andrijauskas\nLight master - Domas Kancauskas\nPhoto - Saulius Jankauskas\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Skalbejos Laundresses\n02 - Tetragonas Tetragon\n03 - Sa Shush\n04 - Asotis Jug\n05 - Pilnatve Completeness\n06 - Surahi Video\n\n*\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdaptatioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nMusic by Zita Vilutyte\n(2007; lossless [FLAC]+working CUEsheet+HQ Album art; 31:05)\n\nADAPTATIO\nMusic, setting, direction by Zita Vilutyte\n\nStars, falling down from the sky, split into thousands of small pieces, bringing hope and light. People come to the Earth to collect their scattered pieces into one new endless ornament and to turn into stars.\nStars sound in the eternal silence. There is neither night nor day only an endless universal harmony, destined to be felt inside ourselves after adjustment of all scattered parts. This is the way the ornament is created: slowly and silently, by combining and joining.\nWorld is large; journey is special; you are given everything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just move and find.\nIdea of the play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdaptatioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was born in a JOURNEY, starting inside ourselves and leading us hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ in uncertainty, where we will go later, because the play reflects our current situation; the next step is available only after the first one is completed. The way is like a centipattern sash, being born in the miraculous weaverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hands. Just one step and the loom interweaves with numerous thread yarns without coincidences because all is adjusted. Our ways are reflected in the stars, stars are reflected in our ways.\nPeople build and lay roads for them and other people for it was easier to travel, but no grass on this way, no life and no love. We choose path across the mountains, rivers and meadows, sands and clouds, because the star is shining always, it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let us to get lost. We are given everything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just we must move and find.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039; - LITHUANIA) - Eyes,Akys\n02 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039; - LITHUANIA) - I keep your heart in my palms,AÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ laikau tavo Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡irdÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¯ savo delnuose\n03 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039; - LITHUANIA) - I hear my way,AÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ girdÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾iu savo keliÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n*\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThird ear (TreÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ioji ausis)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nMusic by Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€\n(2008; lossless [FLAC]+working CUEsheet+HQ Album art; 46:07)\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039;) - Third ear,Trecioji ausis\n02 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039;) - Day and Night,Diena ir Naktis\n03 - Zita VilutytÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Holistic Theatre of Movement &amp;#039;S&amp;#039;) - Pharos,Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â vyturys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23ee4e9bf17748d316a23352ca3f0236eedb73e","amp;dn":"Zita+Vilutyte+-+The+Holistic+Theatre+of+Movement+S+-+3+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23ee4e9bf17748d316a23352ca3f0236eedb73e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,62,228,233,191,23,116,141,49,106,35,53,44,163,240,35,110,237,183,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Windows, by design, \n allows programs to monopolize your CPU without \n restraint - leading to freezes, hangs, and  \n micro-lags. Process Lasso's ProBalance (Process\n Balance) technology intelligently adjusts the  \n priorities of running programs so that badly behaved \n processes won't negatively impact the responsiveness \n of your PC.\n\n Process Lasso also offers an assortment of ways to\n take full control of how your CPUs are allocated to  \n running programs. In essence, it is an all-in-one \n automated Windows process tuner. You can choose at\n what priority processes should run, and which CPUs\n should be assigned to them. You can also disallow \n certain programs from running, log all programs run, \n automatically restart programs, limit the number of  \n instances of a program, and much more. You can even  \n indicate processes that should induce entrance into  \n the High Performance power scheme or prevent the PC  \n from sleeping. A gaming mode also allows for easy \n process priority optimization for avid gamers. \n\n * ProBalance. Balance process priorities (or CPU  \naffinities) in a safe, effective manner to improve \nPC responsiveness during high loads and prevent \nsystem stalls and micro-lags. Our technology does  \nNOT do additional foreground boosting, instead it  \nlowers background process priorities where\nappropriate. Our years of experience have resulted \nin a highly optimal algorithm duplicated nowhere.  \n * Persistent (sticky) priorities and affinities. Set \n'default' (persistent, sticky) priorities and CPU  \naffinities for your processes, allowing you to  \ntweak the way in which they are executed  \n * Auto-terminate. Terminate select processes any  \ntime they are found to be running\n * Process Watchdog. Terminate, restart, or change \nCPU affinity when a specified threshold is met  \n * Instance Count Limits. Limit processes to a  \nspecified number of instances \n * Multi-Core Optimization. Through default CPU \naffinities and ProBalance affinity adjustments, \nyou can optimize your multi-core processor to make \nthe most efficient use of your CPUs (cores). In \nv4.1 (in beta), we also offer logical core\navoidance to improve performance of certain  \napplications on HyperThreaded CPUs. \n * I/O Priority. For Vista and above you can view and \nset the current or default/persistent I/O priority \nof processes\n * Power Scheme Automation. Set the power scheme to\nautomatically change to 'High Performance' when \ncertain processes are running, then change back \nwhen they exit (more powerful in new beta, can  \nchange to any scheme). Save energy, or increase \nperformance on-demand!  \n * System Responsiveness Metric. Our unique algorithm \nmonitors system responsiveness with amazing  \naccuracy \n * Independent Core Engine. This stand-alone \nbackground process can run as a normal process or  \nas a service. This 'core engine', named\nProcessGovernor.exe, is what actually enforces  \nprocess rules and ProBalance. It doesn't need the  \npresence of the GUI (main window) at all. This  \nallows for minimal resource utilization.  \n * Minimal Resource Use. NOBODY uses less resources\nfor this type of task than Process Lasso. It is \nwritten in native C++ and continually refined for  \nmaximum efficiency. A native 64-bit build also  \navailable. Private memory usage by the core engine \nis typically under 1MB! (depends on system)  \n * Utilizes new features of Windows Vista/7. Makes \nuse of latest features of Windows 7, but maintains \nfull backwards compatibility to Windows 000!\n * So much more... Discover for yourself what Process \nLasso can do for you! Quick example of one more \nfeature -- the multi-select feature.. That's \nright, select multiple processes and act on all of \nthem at once!  \n\n Process Lasso runs on all editions of Windows 000,  \n XP, 003, 008, Vista, and Windows 7. As an aside,\n in Windows Vista and Windows 7, adjustments of the\n process priority class also have an effect on the \n I/O and SuperFetch memory priorities for that process.  \n\n Once you install Process Lasso, it will just start\n working. More advanced users can tweak the  \n configuration, but you needn't touch anything to  \n have it instantly improve your system responsiveness \n and prevent stalls in high load situations. Process  \n Lasso is very useful and effective on even the \n latest high-end PCs. However, its ProBalance\n algorithm achieves maximum effect on PCs with  \n relatively little CPU 'power', such as Netbooks,  \n Tablets, and older desktops. \n\n Process Lasso is written in native C++, not .NET .\n The background core engine that manages processes is \n completely independent from the graphical user \n interface, allowing you to keep process rules  \n applied with almost no overhead. With Process Lasso, \n load time is instant and resource consumption is minimal.  \nCOMMENTS  \n   Do NOT distribute this release outside of the scene\n  Keep the scene alive and secure!  \n   INSTALLATION NOTES  \n   `TLB'  \n  Try it, Like it, Buy it!  \n  1. Unpack and install (standard or portable edition) \n . Import the included registry file  \n 3. Copy the included files over the originals  \n\n That's all. Have fun using it! ;-) \n\n___________________________________________________________________  \n\nAlways remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling  \nhome 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic  \nupdates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.  \n  EAT  CONTACT \n \n  EAT is a closed group.

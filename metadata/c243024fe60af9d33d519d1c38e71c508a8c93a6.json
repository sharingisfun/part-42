By highlighting any text on your computer, it can read clearly in the language of your choice, teaching you the pronounciation. It also is useful for the blind and disabled.\n\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\n\tThis is for informational purposes only. This Language Pack V2 Appears to no longer be in production but is too high notch not to perserve. \n\n\tThose who do not want to be forced into the version 3 upgrade, no longer can access these language files online from Acapela. Not everyone likes the new version and some perfer to avoid it the upgrade, staying with Infovox version 2.\n\n\tThis is a pack for those who have lost their former languages due to a system crash. If you have previously lost your language packs and do not want to switch from Infovox 2 to Infovox 3, you would appreciate this program.\n\n\t\n\t\nLANGUAGE MENU\n\n\t\tMexican Spanish Rosa\n\t\tFrance French Bruno\n\t\tDutch Max\n\t\tBrazilian Portuguese Carlos\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\tInfovox Desktop 2.2: A Straight Talking Interface from Acapela\n\n\tInfovox Desktop is a high-end text-to-speech product designed to allow visually impaired people as well as those who are illiterate, dyslexic or who suffer from age related health concerns, to vocally access written information or other accessibility applications using a screen reader. \n\n\tIn an increasingly technical world, users with disabilities are often faced with a number of challenges. Rapid innovations in technology can lead to isolation and frustration. Conversely, advances in the digital age can hugely facilitate daily living where interfaces designed specifically for accessibility are concerned. Infovox Desktop is one such interface. \n\n\tInfovox Desktop speech synthesis can read aloud any written information with very natural and pleasant sounding voices. Users can simply listen to a written text, access their PC with a screen reader, surf the web or control the typing of a text using simultaneous oral spelling.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n\tBy default they all have 30 day trials. I do not recommend anyone using the common online crack for infovox 2 before adding these languages to gain unlimited access to all of these languages. I do not encourage that. Even though this would be quite easy to do with these files, this is for information purposes only and is meant to be downloaded only by those who previously had these languages on their computer previously, lost them due to a crash and are trying to restore their program to the way it was before. \n\n\tYes, I understand how easy it is for you to crack this, but I need you to agree to only download this for informational purposes and nothing more. Only download this if you already have the program.\n\n\tI'm sure many have said before and will tell you to \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t(1) install infovox 2 first, \n\n\t\t(2) install your trial languages second, \n\n\t\t(3) apply the crack making a new key on the desktop, \n\n\t\t(4) open C:ProgramsAcapela GroupInfovox Desktop 2.2License Manager or where ever your License Manager is, \n\n\t\t(5) Click &quot;Import License File&quot; and select the new file which has now appeared on your desktop from the crack, \n\t\t\n\t\t(6) and re-open the License Manager to see all the languages are now unlimited. \n\nI'm sure many will tell you that even though installing new languages after this brings up a &quot;trial message&quot; popup, that they will all show unlimited in the License Manager.\n\t\n\tYet, even though they may say this, do not listen to them. This is only for previous owners of the same program and is not to be cracked in anyway. This is for informational purposes only.\n\n\t\n\t\n\nREQUEST\n\n\tThis is my first torrent. Please seed! Pretty Please! I need a lot of seeders to get this off the ground. Many torrent programs have a schedule under tools, where you can set up your computer to seed and download automatically each night while your sleeping.\n\t\n\tSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED \t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c243024fe60af9d33d519d1c38e71c508a8c93a6","amp;dn":"InfoVox+2%3A+Spanish%2C+French%2C+Dutch%2C+Portugese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c243024fe60af9d33d519d1c38e71c508a8c93a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,67,2,79,230,10,249,211,61,81,157,28,56,231,28,80,138,140,147,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

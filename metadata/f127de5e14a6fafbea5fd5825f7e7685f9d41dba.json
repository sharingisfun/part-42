The debut of writer/director Aldo Lado. \nGreat movie with a wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone\n\nThe corpse of reporter Gregory Moore (Jean Sorel) is found in a Prague plaza and brought to the local morgue. But Moore is actually alive, trapped inside his dead body and desperately recalling how the mysterious disappearance of his beautiful girlfriend (Barbara Bach) led to a terrifying conspiracy of depravity. Can a reporter with no visible signs of life solve this perverse puzzle before he meets his ultimate deadline?\n\nRipped from the Blue Underground release. Encoded with DVD-Shrink. Untouched DVD5.\nWonderful cover to this DVD. If anyone happens to have the original poster (or replica will do in worst case..) I will gladly buy it. \n\nAudio: English 2.0\nSubtitles: None\nPicture: 2.35:1 / 16x9\nFormat: NTSC\nExtras:\n# Strange Days of the Short Night - Interview with Writer/Director Aldo Lado\n# Theatrical Trailer\n# Aldo Lado Filmography \n\nEnjoy!\n\n--------------\n\nCheck my other uploads for more Arthouse, Sleaze, Italo-Westerns, Horror, Cannibals, Sexploitation soundtracks and other weird and cult cinema.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f127de5e14a6fafbea5fd5825f7e7685f9d41dba","amp;dn":"The+Giallo+Collection%3A+Short+night+of+glass+dolls+-+A.Lado+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f127de5e14a6fafbea5fd5825f7e7685f9d41dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,39,222,94,20,166,250,251,234,95,213,130,95,126,118,133,249,212,29,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

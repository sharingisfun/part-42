A history of the most important poets, books and journals as well as publishing circles and events is followed by an analysis of the social basis of Indian English-language poetry, its readership and the literary marketplace. After discussing how a literary canon is being formed, and the best-known poems within this canon, Professor King examines the notions of poetry which have influenced the judgement of English- language verse in India. Subsequent chapters of his book introduce the major poets and their characteristic themes through analysis of such topics as the poets' evolving relationship to India, the influence of Nissim Ezekiel, the work of younger poets, the voices of women, bilingualism, experimentalism, exile and return. The book concludes with a detailed chronology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7b020e1351559180edd0c9a7808eaeec0061e4","amp;dn":"Modern+Indian+poetry+in+English+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7b020e1351559180edd0c9a7808eaeec0061e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,123,2,14,19,81,85,145,128,237,208,201,167,128,142,174,236,0,97,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She brings an energy and presence that is captivating, and her band is a finely tuned machine, that amps up the energy onstage to feverish levels. \n\nSo, when the time was right to write and record Ã¢â‚¬Å“White Noise,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ her latest album, while there were a lot of ideas that came forward, as she put it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“One thing was for certain, and that was that I needed this album to be a better representation of our live showÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ more energy!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe creative process was very structured. \nCain teamed up with longtime friend and mentor, Paige Logan, to get the process moving. \nWhile the ideas were flowing, studio time was booked so that they could get these ideas down, and in such a manner to hopefully avoid the curse of over-production. \nA couple of weeks in between to keep the creative process going, listen to rough mixes, etc.. rinse and repeat. \nGuests were brought in for some Ã¢â‚¬Å“extraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on songs, most notably Jeff LeBar (guitarist for Cinderella, who Cain backed up on the road) on Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GoldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Any Given Sunday.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nArtist: Jasmine Cain\n\nTitle Of Album: White Noise\n\nYear Of Release: 2015\nLabel: Jasmine Cain\nGenre: Rock, Hard Rock, Female Vocal\n\nFormat: Mp3\nQuality: 320 kbps\n\nTotal Time: 40:10 Min\nTotal Size: 100 Mb\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

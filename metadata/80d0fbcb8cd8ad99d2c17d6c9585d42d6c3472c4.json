One of the leading experts in the field and author of several books on the topic including the most recent Alien Interviews Marzulli looks at the current manifestations of UFO activity worldwide and relates these experiences to what ancient texts say about them, as well as current understanding. There is no doubt that UFOs are here and not going away. What does this mean? What are interdimensional beings? What are Orbs and why are all these things happening now? Has humanity finally become enlightened enough to accept new life forms? This documentary will bring LA Marzulli, a favorite on the wildly popular Coast to Coast AM, into a realistic discussion on UFOs, entities, and actual facts that are surrounding them.\n\nWatchers 2.\n\nWhy are the nations of the world in turmoil? What is happening with the sun and the moon? Why is it that birds are dropping out of the air dead, and why have fish numbering into the millions suddenly died without explanation? Why are there sinkholes of gigantic proportions appearing all over the earth, and what is happening with volcanic eruptions in Japan, Italy and Iceland? And what about the UFO seen over the Temple Mount? Something has changed, and Watchers 2 will try and investigate if what ancient texts have said for millenniums are true -- that we are entering a period where there will be wars, earthquakes, and famines -- including signs in the skies and the heavens. L.A. Marzulli will comment as well as interview experts on this volume. Including: Chuck Missler, Rabbi Aaron Parry, Stan Deyo, Jim Wilhelmsen, Helena Lehman. Dr. Roger Leir will also give us his update on alien implants.\n\n\nWatchers 3.\nL.A. Marzulli, author of the Cosmic Chess Match and popular guest on talk shows such as Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, hosts the third installment of the Watchers series. All over the world mysterious and unexplained events continue with little or no explanation from our governments or media. People are seeing multiple suns or hearing strange, anomalous sounds. NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SOHO images seem to be revealing unknown objects around the sun. Planet X/Nibiru Ã¢â‚¬â€œ could there be large unseen forces affecting our solar system? Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Shroud of Turin, which may be the most probed, enigmatic artifact on the planet. L.A. talks with two of the premier experts: recently knighted The Right Honorable Barrie Schwortz, whose photographs of the Shroud are iconic, and Dame Isabel Piczek, muralist and particle physicist. With the unprecedented Arab Spring, how does the unrest in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Jordan affect Israel? Is this uprising of millions of people being fanned by unseen supernatural forces? Later, the world experts weigh in on the Torah Codes, explaining how science and an understanding of ancient Hebrew are both required to get the best results. What new updates have been discovered by Dr. Roger Leir? Have so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“alien implantsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ become more inscrutable and is there evidence that the technology may be ramping up for some unknown purpose? L.A. Marzulli will interview the experts on each topic. Watchers 3 has the most impressive line-up so far in the series.\n\n\n\nThe Watchers 4\nYet another amazing DVD from L.A. Marzulli's Watchers series. Watchers 4 is a must have for anyone interested in what is really going on around the world.\n\n\nThe Watchers 5\nPinlight began in the Fall of 2010 with &quot;The Watchers,&quot; the first DVD about UFOs.

Watchers 5 also includes new reenactments of the real life stories our guests describe, and a chilling drama of the Black Eyed Children. These are not fictional dramas, but reenactments of actual events. It's not for the faint of heart. Watchers just wants to get to the bottom of the truth, and at times it may upset you. However, you won't find another series brave enough to tackle these topics. All in reference to ancient texts and the Bible.\n\nThe DVDs are available directly through L.A. Marzulli's website, or on Amazon.

Something is happening. More and more people around the globe are realizing that UFO sightings are real, and they are not going away. We'll take you to one of the worlds leading experts in UFO's Jaime Maussan. We travelled to mexico to mexico and interviewed Hymie and his staff. We saw unbelievable things. We'll take you inside and show you that incredible footage. Jose Escamilla will show us what might be hidden structures on the lunar surface. We'll take you into the lab and examine evidence, physical evidence of UFO encounters. We'll also show you samples that we took from a sphere that supposedly fell from space into a farmers field. At the citizens hearing on UFO disclosure in Washington D.C. Six congressman got to hear incredible things. We sat down with Stephen Bassett, the organizer of the conference and discussed it with him. We also talked to Chris Putnam, co-author of the best selling book Exo-Vaticana. we sat down with chris and asked him to explain what the Vatican's relationship is with the extra-terrestrial phenomena. The data says that more people believe in extra-terrestrials than believe in God. we also interviewed Dr. David Jacob, who took us inside the alien abduction Phenomena. Dr. Jacob also weighs in on what he thinks the end game might be to the alien abduction phenomenon.\n\nIn Depth Interviews with:\n\n  Gary Stearman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Host of Prophecy in the News\n  Stephen Bassett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Organizer of the Citizens Hearing on UFOs in Washington DC\n  Cris Putnam Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Co-author of EXO-Vaticana\n  George Filer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Former Colonel and UFO witness\n  Chuck Missler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Author &amp; Biblical Scholar\n  Dr. David Jacobs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Abduction researcher\n  Jamie Maussan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Host of the weekly UFO program seen by over 4 million people in Mexico each week\n  David Stinnett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UFO researcher\n  Jim Wilhelmsen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Author and UFO researcher\n  Jose Escamilla Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UFO investigator\n  Dr. Roger Leir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Implant removal\n  Steven Colbern Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chief Scientist for A. &amp; S. Research\n\n\nThe Nephilim\n\n\nThe term &quot;Nephilim&quot; occurs just twice in the Hebrew Bible, both in the Torah. The first is Genesis 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 NAS, immediately before the story of Noah's ark:\n\n  Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.&quot; The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\n\nThe second is Numbers 13:32Ã¢â‚¬â€œ33 NAS, where the Twelve Spies report that they have seen fearsome giants in Canaan:\n\n  So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, &quot;The land through which we had gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.\n\nThe nature of the nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis 6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the &quot;sons of God&quot; or their offspring who are the &quot;mighty men of old, men of renown&quot;. Richard Hess in The Anchor Bible Dictionary takes it to mean that the nephilim are the offspring,[11] as does P. W. Coxon in Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible.[12]\n\n\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 01 - The Real Truth - Noahs Ark DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 02 - The Real Truth - Noahs Ark DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 03 - The Real Truth - The Watcher Angels DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 04 - The Real Truth - The Watcher Angels DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 05 - The Real Truth - The Nephilim - Genesis 6 DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 06 - The Real Truth - The Nephilim - Genesis 6 DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 07 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 08 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 09 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 10 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d0fbcb8cd8ad99d2c17d6c9585d42d6c3472c4","amp;dn":"B+I+B+L+E+-+L+I+E+S+-+Part+04+-+The+Real+Truth+-+The+Watcher+Ang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d0fbcb8cd8ad99d2c17d6c9585d42d6c3472c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,208,251,203,140,216,173,153,210,193,125,108,149,133,212,45,108,52,114,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

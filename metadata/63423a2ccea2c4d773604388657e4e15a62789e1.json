You'll find here a new torrent for this Japan only limited release (4k units) \n\nexperimental trip made by the English studio Tomato and silently published by Sony Music Entertainment Japan on March 10th of \n\n2004.\n\nThe previous upload made in 2008 is long dry and I've lost the original files since then, hence this new torrent.\n\n_________\n\n\nThe files are just one plain 1:1 image. \nNothing stripped or modified from the original data. \n\n_________\n\n\nDescription:\n\nwordimagesoundplay is a music experience &quot;game&quot; for the PlayStation2. The title features music from Underworld and Tomato.\n\n\nThe software is made up of four main parts:\n\n\nMiracles &amp; Wonders\nA mysterious story is told in a three-dimensional space, which can be traversed  infinitely. The music is a collection of \n\nremixed Underworld tracks, lasting more than 20 minutes.\n\n\nSleeping eye\nFind the hidden links between 15 different compositions. \n\nGraphics and sound provided by Tomato.\n\n\nLatLongStories\nTwo separate stories are told on the screen, one vertically, and one horizontally (representing latitude and longitude). \n\nThe stories merge together and the intersection becomes a hyperlink.\n\n\nPhonology\nEight people appear on the screen and each one can be used as a channel of sound.

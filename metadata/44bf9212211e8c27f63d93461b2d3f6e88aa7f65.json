Many fruits and vegetables contain high levels of it naturally. Dr. Johnson shows how to cut way back on the sweetener by making effective substitutions. The daily meal plans included here contain no more than 25 grams of fructose, one-quarter of the amount the average American now ingests.\n\nRather than the low-carb approach of so many recent diets, Dr. Johnson recommends a much easier to enjoy and stick to formula: 50% carbs, 25% fat, and 25% protein. The immediate benefit of this diet is to help anyone shed excess weight. The additional benefits are even more impressiveÃ¢â‚¬â€reduced risk for such serious health problems as high blood pressure, elevated blood fats, and insulin resistance, conditions directly linked to heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and stroke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bf9212211e8c27f63d93461b2d3f6e88aa7f65","amp;dn":"The+Sugar+Fix+by+Johnson+and+Gower+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bf9212211e8c27f63d93461b2d3f6e88aa7f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,191,146,18,33,30,140,39,246,61,147,70,27,45,63,110,136,170,127,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

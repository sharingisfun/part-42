In 2004 Dogs on Acid was given its own imprint, which was ostensibly created to release tracks from the site's users; however as of 2007 it has only put out 3 releases, all produced by artists with previous releases on other labels.\nFresh has worked with artists ranging from Pet Shop Boys, DJ Shadow, Apollo 440 to Andy C and Grooverider.\nFresh has had his own tracks included on a number of commercially-released mix CDs including the 2006 release &quot;Jungle Sound: The Bassline Strikes Back!&quot;, Andy C's &quot;Nightlife&quot; series, DJ Hype's &quot;Drum and Bass Warfare&quot;, and Goldie's &quot;Drum and Bass Classics&quot;.\nIn 2006, Fresh released his first studio album, &quot;Escape from Planet Monday&quot;, featuring the already successful singles[citation needed] &quot;The Immortal&quot;, &quot;X Project&quot;, &quot;Nervous&quot; and &quot;All that Jazz&quot; on Breakbeat Kaos.\n[edit]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929dc5348e3ec5badc4ae330c37d002d0361d285","amp;dn":"DJ.Fresh.Escape.From.Planet.Monday.2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929dc5348e3ec5badc4ae330c37d002d0361d285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,157,197,52,142,62,197,186,220,74,227,48,195,125,0,45,3,97,210,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

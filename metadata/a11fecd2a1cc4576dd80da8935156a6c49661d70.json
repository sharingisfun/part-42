Do you often find yourself, when listening to one of them, wishing you \nwere listening to the other, just to hear a bit of music or lyric you're missing?\n\nThe Beach Boys recordings have a quality that the 2004 performance can't touch. \nHowever, the 2004 album contains lyrics and music that don't exist in any 60s form, \nand shapes the SMiLE album into a surprisingly coherent whole.\n\nA professional release couldn't merge the two; that's musical sacrilege.\n\nBut for the purposes of this edit, that's exactly what I've done - switch back and \nforth from 60s recordings to 2004 ones within the same track, so that nearly every \npiece of music or lyric you might want to hear is there.\n\nAnd it's nearly all in stereo!\n\nI tried something very unusual with the &quot;Water&quot; section - Recorded as I Love to Say \nDa Da, Cool Cool Water, and In Blue Hawaii. I extended this section to quite a \nlength, deciding to use all three songs, plus the unrelated song &quot;Little Pad&quot; from\n the Smiley Smile album. So this is essentially In Blue Hawaii from the 2004 album,\n with sections of Cool Cool Water and Little Pad interspersed.\n\nIf you think that's dumb, the extensions are their own track and can be removed to\n leave just In Blue Hawaii.\n\nAlso, the bonus track &quot;He Gives Speeches&quot; is now combined with Smiley Smile's\n &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; as one track.\n\nApart from that, all of the material is from the 2011 Smile sessions boxset or the\n 2004 Brian Wilson Smile album.\n\nHowever, I used other people's fanedits for many of the tracks. Soniclovenoize's\n stereo version of SMiLE was used for many of the 60s tracks, notably his version \nof Good Vibrations with the original lyrics.\n\nBruiteur's versions of Barnyard and I'm in Great Shape were used, which cleans up \nthe piano demos for a much clearer vocal - although Barnyard is the stereo take on \nthat by another fan. I also used Bruiteur's &quot;Wonderful,&quot; which marries the 60s \nvocal to the 2004 instruments.\n\nI believe I used adam78's mono edits in places as well. Not sure though, as I tried \nto avoid mono.\n\n&quot;You're Welcome,&quot; &quot;He Gives Speeches&quot; and a few later Beach Boys tracks are thrown \non as bonuses.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBrian Wilson and the Beach Boys - SMiLE \nThe 3971 Edit\nby Tygerbug\n\nAlso uploaded [mega, that is] at ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âª?d=UY3IFI00ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¬\n314.82 MB FLAC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a11fecd2a1cc4576dd80da8935156a6c49661d70","amp;dn":"SMiLE+%28Brian+Wilson%2FBeach+Boys%29+3971+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a11fecd2a1cc4576dd80da8935156a6c49661d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,31,236,210,161,204,69,118,221,128,218,137,53,21,106,108,73,102,29,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

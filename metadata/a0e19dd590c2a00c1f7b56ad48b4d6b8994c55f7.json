The main idea i keep in mind when i recorded it is 2 offer a fast 1, without lose time in tactic defensive combat, or searching 4 life potions, or taking unusefull weapons. Sort of &quot;time attack&quot; 1. This is because i play full of cheats: long range weapons, infinite life, high level, etc...\n\nAlso, i recorded it in &quot;low definition&quot; (320x240 with low bitrate), so you can store it in less hard drive space than the game itself. Sorry 4 the low quality of the movies, and i hope you aprecciate it provided you want 2 watch/download the complete collection. The codec setup i used (you have the technical stuff downstair) drops a size of 2 mb/min; i think is an acceptable balance quality/size.\n\nIf you are looking 4 hd severance movies without use cheats, we cannot help you here. You have plenty of them in youtube.\n\nFinally, i used my own music collection in the movies. Most is techno stuff (but not only). If you dont like it, please, remember that you can mute the sound, quite 2 the reverse i'm gonna do with the comments. I'm sure you are gonna understand what i mean...\n\nFell free 2 rate and comment (or not), but not 2 subscribe, since i dont have in mind 2 release more videos soon.\n\n4 those people that cannot enjoy the complete collection due the copyright trouble, i'm gonna try to offer it in our favourite p2p place ;) Patience since i don't have internet conection anytime.\n\t\nMusic theme:\n01 tabriz: now-a-days techno\n02 kelbegen: classic based trance \n03 tell-halaf: prodigy\n04 ephyra: demoscene\n05 karum: epic\n06 shalatuwar: old school techno\n07 orlok: 2cellos\n08 nemrut: lain\n09 nejeb: anime opening\n10 al-farum: french pop\n11 xathra: spanish rock\n12 ianna: melancholia\n13 dal-gurak: goa \n14 abyss: goa\n\nCodec specifications\nContainer: mp4\nVideo codec: h264\nVideo resolution: 320x240\nVideo fps: 25\nVideo bitrate: 240 kbps\nAudio codec: aac (sbr+ps)\nAudio channels: estereo\nAudio bitrate: 16 kbps\nAudio hz: 44100\n\nSoftware i have used (provided you wanna do the same):\nMusic player: vlc\nVideo capture: fraps\nVideo encoder: real anime 6\n\nMy computer:\nProcessor: intel atom n270 1.60ghz\nRam: 1gb\nGraphic card: mobile intel 945 224mb\n\nThx 4 watching.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e19dd590c2a00c1f7b56ad48b4d6b8994c55f7","amp;dn":"severance+ld+fast+walkthrough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e19dd590c2a00c1f7b56ad48b4d6b8994c55f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,225,157,213,144,194,160,12,31,123,86,173,72,180,214,184,153,76,85,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

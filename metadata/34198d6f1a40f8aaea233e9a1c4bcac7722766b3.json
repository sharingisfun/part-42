Truman commissioned a top-secret residential development in a remote area of the Pacific Northwest, one that would serve to protect and nurture America's most valuable intellectual resources. There our nation's greatest thinkers, the ÃƒÂ¼ber-geniuses working on the next era of scientific achievement, would be able to live and work in a supportive environment. The best architects and planners were commissioned to design a welcoming place for these superlative geniuses to reside, an area that would offer the best education for their children, the best healthcare, the best amenities and quality of life. A community was created to rival the most idyllic of America's small towns - with one major difference: this town would never appear on any maps. At least, none that haven't been classified &quot;eyes only&quot; by the Pentagon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34198d6f1a40f8aaea233e9a1c4bcac7722766b3","amp;dn":"Eureka+S05+Complete+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34198d6f1a40f8aaea233e9a1c4bcac7722766b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,25,141,111,26,64,248,170,234,35,62,154,28,75,202,199,114,39,102,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

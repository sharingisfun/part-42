While out on a run in the middle of the night, a young girl runs into him on the seaside boardwalk. Barefoot and terrified, sheâ€™s running from a group of heavily armed men with one clear goalâ€”to kill the fleeing child. After Dryden helps her evade her pursuers, he learns that the eleven year old, for as long as she can remember, has been kept in a secret prison by forces within the government. But she doesnâ€™t know much beyond her own name, Rachel. She only remembers the past two months of her lifeâ€”and that she has a skill that makes her very dangerous to these men and the hidden men in charge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb264151d2f6426f4872f71606fee716d7a45ed1","amp;dn":"Patrick+Lee+-+Runner+%28Sam+Dryden+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb264151d2f6426f4872f71606fee716d7a45ed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,38,65,81,210,246,66,111,72,114,247,22,6,254,231,22,215,164,94,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

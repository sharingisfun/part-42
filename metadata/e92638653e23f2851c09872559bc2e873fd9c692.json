You will be mining resources, automating production, managing energy sources, designing the flow of items in your factory, researching technologies and defending from hostile creatures. \n\nWhat is the game inspired by? \nWe drew a lot of inspiration from Transport Tycoon-like games, Civilization and Minecraft. \n\nWhy should I care? \nThis game is made by geeks for geeks. The core of the game is building things. You can create huge almost self sufficient factories. There are machines crafting other machines. All the stuff is travelling on transport belts. There are simple means of &quot;programming&quot; the robotic arms that move things around. You also have little logistic robots that transport things among designated containers. The ultimate goal of course is to have self replicating factories:) \n\nWhen &amp; where can I get it? \nPublic demo is available at (win, osx, ubuntu linux). Go and try it now. \nThe game is at the moment raising funds for further development. If it succeeds the alpha will be released in March 2013. \n\nI want to know more \nCheck our website for trailer, screenshots, demo download and more information in general.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92638653e23f2851c09872559bc2e873fd9c692","amp;dn":"Factorio+v0.11.22+%282015%29%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92638653e23f2851c09872559bc2e873fd9c692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,38,56,101,62,35,242,133,28,9,135,37,89,188,46,135,63,217,198,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

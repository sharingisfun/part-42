Hackers are concentrating their efforts on web-based applications - shopping carts, forms, login pages, dynamic content, etc. Web applications are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and control valuable data since they often have direct access to back-end data such as customer databases.\n\n\n\n\nFirewalls, SSL and Locked-Down Servers are Futile Against Web Application Hacking\n\n\n\n\nAny defence at network security level will provide no protection against web application attacks since they are launched on port 80 - which has to remain open. In addition, web applications are often tailor-made therefore tested less than off-the-shelf software and are more likely to have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner automatically checks your web applications for SQL Injection, XSS &amp; other web vulnerabilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90224b9dc6935129371b87050ac840e7eb227ba","amp;dn":"Acunetix+8+version+2013_06_26+%5Bmindcrasher%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d90224b9dc6935129371b87050ac840e7eb227ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,2,36,185,220,105,53,18,147,113,184,112,80,172,132,14,126,178,39,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

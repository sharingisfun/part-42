Gator\n \nIn a satire of erotic anthologies like Red Shoe Diaries, Phil reads a letter from Reducto detailing \n\nhis affair with Norlissa, the curvaceous ex-girlfriend of Black Vulcan. She is possessed of \n\nenormous buttocks, and when Reducto finds himself unwilling to shrink it, he falls into a state of \n\nexistential angst. Meanwhile, Birdman is made a bounty hunter so he can apprehend and represent \n\nWally Gator, a volatile redneck. Reducto progressively enlarges Norlissa's butt as they draw closer \n\ntogether. It is revealed that Reducto is a virgin, though he is broken of it by Norlissa during an \n\nawkward love scene. They are eventually confronted by Black Vulcan the morning after and engage in \n\na threesome relationship. The Wally Gator case draws to a close with Wally being found guilty of \n\npoaching manatees, and he is sentenced to mud-wrestle Harvey, an Abraham Lincoln impersonator and \n\ntwo bikini models, while Phil plays the bongos at a Cha-cha club.

Birdman\n \nIn the opening, Murro the Maurader is fighting Birdman and Avenger. They defeat him, and fly away, \n\nnot realizing that he has been paralyzed from the waist down. \nDecades later, Murro sues Birdman. Birdman needs a good lawyer, but somehow ends up with Potamus, \n\nwho is more interested in making out with the female staff than working on Birdman's case.\n\nIn court, Murro's lawyer Shado uses his &quot;brain-thievery&quot; to influence the jury. His villainous \n\nwitnesses testify that Birdman had no reason to attack them; Shado also uses his brain-thievery to \n\nprevent Potamus from cross-examining them.\n\nShado contends that his brain-thievery is fundamentally different from Mentok's &quot;mind-taking&quot;, \n\nhowever the two get into frequent one-up-manship contests over their skills. Finally Mentok, tiring \n\nof the upstart Shado, delves into his mind and takes away an important fact: Shado failed to \n\nrespond to a discovery motion filed by Potamus.\n\nMentok hypnotises Potamus to ask Shado &quot;did you get that thing I sent you?&quot;. When Shado answers \n\nthat he did, and failed to respond, Mentok declares a mistrial.

Rabbit\n \nX wins Birdman's Crest in a game of what appears to be poker, although Peanut claims it's gin \n\nrummy. He cannot collect his million dollar commission, however, as F.E.A.R. moved its headquarters \n\nand left no forwarding address. \nMeanwhile, Birdman falls deeper and deeper into defeatism. He takes on Ricochet Rabbit's case \n\nagainst the town of Hoop'n'Holler after Ricochet destroyed half the town on one of his hyperactive \n\noutbursts. The town wants Ricochet's badge and Harvey agrees to help. The case goes badly, with \n\nHarvey's self-esteem at a low ebb and Ricochet Rabbit destroying half the courtroom, with Reducto \n\naccounting for most of the other half trying to shrink him. Mentok rules that Ricochet Rabbit has \n\nADD, ADHD and OPP (which stands for &quot;Other People's Problems&quot;, and is not a disease), and court-\n\norders Ricochet to be medicated with rabbit Ritalin.\n\nThe Crest takes over X's mind, causing him to become a hero. In the end, Harvey tricks X into \n\nreturning his Crest by trading him a shinier (but useless) one.

Mole\n \nIt's 'Take Phil's Daughter to Work Day', so naturally Phil brings his daughter, Judy. Harvey agrees \n\nto defend Morrocco Mole, who has been detained as a terrorist for two years after being discovered \n\nin the Middle East. While defending Morrocco, Harvey also has to deal with being bothered by \n\nBirdgirl, who has a striking resemblance to Judy Sebben. Birdgirl in turn has to fend off the \n\nadvances of Phil, who continually sexually harasses her, oblivious to her true identity.

Although made in 2005, the short purports to \n\nbe from 1967, and features many of the modern show's characters in their original incarnations, \n\nalbeit with modern ironic overtones. Under orders from Falcon Seven, Birdman spends the day foiling \n\nthe plots of numerous supervillains, including Reducto, Vulturo, Mentok, and X the Eliminator. At \n\nthe end of the day, exhausted, Birdman resolves to quit being a superhero and take up a normal job \n\n(which involves Phil Ken Sebben constantly ordering him around). \nNotes:\n\nThough the short is supposed to be from 1967, it includes a reference to Star Wars Episode IV: A \n\nNew Hope, released a full decade later. \nThe short was introduced by Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies. \n\n Plaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nDefendant- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nJudge- N/A \nDescription- N/A \nDecision- N/A \nQuotes- Episode 25 Dialogue Link \nCameos- N/A \n \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n26 Beyond the Valley of the Dinosaurs Richard Ferguson-Hull August 28, 2005 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nSummary Tana v. Gokk\n \nHarvey is invited by Potamus to relax in his new hot tub, wearing a pink shower terry that Potamus \n\nhas told him to put on. Potamus instructs Harvey to &quot;hit the jets&quot; on the tub and when Harvey does \n\nso he is enveloped in a blue light and sucked into the swirling waters of the tub. Potamus follows \n\nHarvey, trying to retrieve his hoagie. Harvey and Potomus rematerialize in what appears to be the \n\nStone Age. Harvey attempts to call Peanut (who seems to be hosting a Lamaze class in Potomus' \n\noffice) but can't get a clear enough signal on his mobile phone. Harvey is caught by a group of \n\nneanderthal cave men who believe he's the &quot;pink manbird&quot; (because he's still wearing the shower \n\nterry) their oracle had foretold would bring them pestilence and drought. When Potomus appears they \n\nmistake him for their pink hippo helmet-wearing God, which Potomus gladly embraces. \nPhil manages to find out about the portal in the hot tub and brings Peanut, Avenger, and a Star \n\nTrek character parody to the past. Phil takes advantage of the limitless resources and lack of \n\neconomy to start up several business ventures including theme parks and dinosaur hunting. \n\nMeanwhile, Harvey serves council to a cave woman who wants to leave her husband for another (exact \n\nduplicate-looking) cave man, while Potomus serves as judge. Harvey convinces Potomus not to \n\nsacrifice the woman (as the other cave men demand) but to give her and her husband marriage \n\ncounseling - Phil tries to volunteer for it but Harvey decides to do it himself. Phil eventually \n\nangers the cave men and Potomus is discovered to be a sham so they all rush back to the watery \n\nportal but realize a little too late that the neanderthals and their dinosaurs followed them to the \n\npresent. They all laugh and the Star Trek parody gets eaten by a T-Rex.\n\nNotes:\nThe title of this episode is a cross between Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and Valley of the \n\nDinosaurs. \n\n Plaintiff- Gokk \nRepresentative- N/A \nDefendan-t Tana \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge- Peter Potamus \nDescription- Criminal trial; Tana wants to leave her husband. \nDecision- Marriage counseling.

School Board\n \nThe school that Cavey Junior is attending refuses to teach evolution, claiming that it is just a \n\nmyth, so his father (Captain Caveman) takes legal action, through Harvey Birdman. Peanut is sent to \n\nhelp prove evolution, but ends up spending all his time at a local strip club. Harvey has an \n\nidentity crisis when Reducto asks him where a half man, half bird fits into the process of \n\nevolution, which involves him bursting into a Disney style song. \nThe next day at court, Mentok messes with a chiseler who tries to put up a stone tablet of the Ten \n\nCommandments in front of the courthouse, and Peanut tells Harvey to call Magilla Gorilla to the \n\nstand to prove evolution (a talking ape) but the jury is unsatisfied. When Cavey Junior takes the \n\nstand he points out that he read the evolution chapter, not because he wanted to learn and expand \n\nhis mind, but because the chapter was required for the &quot;federally mandated no child left behind \n\ntest&quot; necessary to move onto the next grade. Mentok declares, after pranking the courtroom, that \n\nthe school can teach whatever they want, and that Cavey Junior is merely a theory, not a real \n\nchild.\n\nWorth mentioning that over the course of the episode, Phil was battling the cave men and dinosaurs \n\nwho were still roaming the streets from the previous episode. He joins Harvey at the end and gets \n\nhimself a drink from a vending machine (with a frozen Flintstone family inside).\n\nNotes:\nThe episode title is a play on &quot;Evolution&quot; and the &quot;Revolutionary War&quot;. \n\n Plaintiff- Captain Caveman \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nDefendant- School Board \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nJudge- Mentok the Mindtaker \nDescription- Civil Rights; Captain Caveman sues for the right of his son's education. \nDecision The judge gives the school the right to teach whatever they want to; declares that the \n\ndefendant and his son do not exist, and makes the defendant's son wear a disclaimer sticker. \nQuotes- Episode 27 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Captain Caveman, Cavey Junior, Doggie Daddy, Snagglepuss, Tinker, Hokey Wolf, Magilla \n\nGorilla, The Flintstones \n \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n28 Free Magilla  September 9, 2005 \n------------------------------------\n Summary Peebles Pet Shop v. Peoples Animal Freedom Front\n \nMagilla Gorilla gets freed from Mr. Peebles' pet shop by the People's Animals Freedom Front. Mr. \n\nPeebles comes to Harvey Birdman to get Magilla back. Also, Phil Ken Sebben takes Peter Potamus (and \n\nhis three nephews Stuey, Fuey and Spuey; see Huey, Dewey, and Louie) along for an employee retreat, \n\nwhere Peter Potamus spends most of his time choking on a plastic beer can holder and Phil randomly \n\nblows stuff up and doesn't pay attention to Peter Potamus at all. Members of the People's Animals \n\nFreedom Front attack Harvey's office because they don't approve of him &quot;owning&quot; Avenger. \n\nEventually, PAFF get sick of Magilla Gorilla's puns and they abandon him in a forest. In court (in \n\nfront of an off-screen judge) Harvey tries to defend himself and Mr. Peabody against accusations of \n\nanimal abuse but the radical activists will not be swayed. Eventually Avenger finds and brings back \n\nMagilla who wants to go back to living with Mr. Peebles.\n Plaintiff- Mr. Peebles \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nDefendant- PAFF (Peoples Animal Freedom Front) \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nJudge- N/A \nDescription- N/A \nDecision- N/A \nQuotes- Episode 28 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Magilla Gorilla, Mr. Peebles, Bandit, Scrappy-Doo, Jonny Quest, Hadji \n \n --=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n29 Return of Birdgirl Richard Ferguson-Hull September 18, 2005\n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nSummary People v. Bannon &amp; Quest\n \nBirdgirl brings to Harvey's attention a case where Dr. Quest and Race Bannon want to have a legal \n\ngay marriage to protect the boys. At the office, Birdgirl continues to be hit on by Phil and she \n\nreluctantly goes on a date with him lest he figure out she's actually his daughter. Mentok informs \n\nHarvey and his clients that he doesn't have the authority to try the case; they must argue it \n\nbefore the Justices League ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a group of seven robed super-judges (a humorous reference to both the \n\nSupreme Court of the United States and the Justice League). Birdgirl assist Harvey with the case in \n\nbetween forced dates with Phil and eventually Phil proposes to her, much to Birdgirl's horror. Phil \n\ncondemns the idea of marriage between Dr. Quest and Race and out of her Birdgirl costume, Judy \n\ntries to keep her father from going through with the marriage by claiming Birdgirl is interested in \n\nBirdman. There's a quick fight and an injured Harvey Birdman goes before the Justices to hear the \n\nverdict... which never comes because they're called to action via telecommunicator. Afterward, \n\nBirdman interrupts the Sebben wedding and finally tells Phil that Birdgirl is his daughter but Phil \n\nstill doesn't believe him.

Meanwhile Mentok has a personal crisis in \n\ncourt and swaps a dog's mind for Spyro's; he loses track of Spyro's mind and is forced to look \n\nafter Spyro until he finds his mind. Mentok rules that Harvey and the cats should serve time in \n\nremand but is forced to rule on the case when he needs Harvey to babysit Spyro.

Tinker\n \nChemical Castration (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Yakky Doodle; see &quot;Gone Efficien...t&quot; above) wants his old name back, which \n\nrequires photocopying paper work. So Harvey Birdman goes to Duplication Services but he unwittingly \n\ninsults the employee by getting his name wrong (mispronouncing &quot;Elliott&quot; as &quot;Eliot&quot; (&quot;ee-lee-\n\nought&quot;)). Despite the fact the name was spelled wrongly on his name tag, Elliott swears revenge and \n\nstarts creating &quot;copies&quot; of Harvey. These copies are not photocopies but rather whole humans, \n\napparently clones, that share Harvey's personality and knowledge. Unfortunately they get along, so \n\nhe starts copying Phil Ken Sebben, who starts hunting Birdmans to thin the herds. Elliott then \n\nloses all control and make copies of everyone. Elliott only stops when he runs out of toner; the \n\ncopies are subsequently shredded. \nNotes:\n\nThe whole episode itself is a satire of how many classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons are rip-offs of one \n\nanother (ex. Scooby-Doo, Jabberjaw, and Speed Buggy are all mystery-solving cartoons involving \n\nobjects/animals as focal characters who can talk, and how certain members of each mystery solving \n\nteam look like each other, like Shaggy, Clamhead, and Mr. Tinker) and how animation styles done by \n\ndifferent people looked very different (ex. different looking Ranger Smiths on Yogi Bear). \nSebben's final words before he is put through the shredder are a parody of the last words of Roy \n\nBatty, a character played by Rutger Hauer in the 1982 film Blade Runner.\n \n Plaintiff- Clamhead \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nDefendant- Tinker \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge Mentok- the Mind Taker \nDescription- The plaintiff claims the defendant stole his identity. \nDecision- Not shown. \nQuotes- Episode 32 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Yakky Doodle, Clamhead, Tinker, Shaggy Rogers, Ranger Smith, Daphne Blake \n\n--------------------\nCast\n--------\nSeries Cast\n\n Gary Cole ...

Our attempts always fall short, our fears continue or grow, and often we are caught following the old maps rather than making new ones. Making new maps not only can open the road to moving beyond our fears, it also can afford us so much more freedom. Making new maps, we can be free and become freer.  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Making_New_Maps_Not_Following_P930C104.cfmMaking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Making_New_Maps_Not_Following_P930C104.cfmMaking&lt;/a&gt;  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e14ca39cece25716d9a79e42d607105dfe096d1","amp;dn":"Lazaris+-+Illuminating+Dialogues+With+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e14ca39cece25716d9a79e42d607105dfe096d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,20,202,57,206,206,37,113,109,154,121,228,45,96,113,5,223,224,150,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In this hilarious twist on a familar tale, the infant Superman's rocket ship crash lands in an English town even smaller than Smallville. Adopted by the kindly Clarks, young Colin is taught to hide his powers, as nobody likes to stand out in a crowd. But when a grown-up Colin - now a mild-mannered reporter for The Daily Smear - uses his powers publicly, the question on everyone's lips is: what will the neighbours think? Featuring art by superstar John Byrne, this is a publishing event not to be missed!\n\n.cbr file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f89cb4b5cc3951d07f5fa44494a79011a59162","amp;dn":"Superman%3A+True+Brit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f89cb4b5cc3951d07f5fa44494a79011a59162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,248,156,180,181,204,57,81,208,127,95,164,68,148,167,144,17,165,145,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

If you thought it couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get any weirder, this season will prove you wrong. But the good news is that South Park has always been able to maintain a mathematical-like balance of proportionality so impressive it could be charted on a graph: as South Park gets weirder, so it gets funnier (usually). Which makes sense because one of South ParkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest strengths has always been to reflect the strangest elements of society, which, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it, are pretty strange. Targets this season include exploitive daytime TV shows (&quot;Freak Strike&quot;), celebrities gone wild (Russell Crowe fightinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ round the world), the Catholic priest sexual-abuse scandals (&quot;Red Hot Catholic Love&quot;), and the meat industry (&quot;Fun With Veal&quot;). Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker even parody the reality of competing with The SimpsonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longevity in &quot;The Simpsons Already Did It,&quot; where Butters, gone out of his mind and in his Professor Chaos persona, canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even come up with an original evil scheme to unleash on the citizens of South Park. Fortunately for fans, the quality of the writing is as strong this season as it has been at any point in the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s run, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not like the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to back off from its trademark gross-out factor at this point. Proof of that can be found in &quot;The Death Camp of Tolerance.&quot; In an extreme satire of sex education class, Mr. Slave and Lemmiwinks, the heroic and intensely unfortunate gerbil, make their, umm, debuts. In South Park, this is what qualifies as a normal school day. Taken as a whole, Season Six is one of the show's strongest punches yet to the face of a society that had it coming. --Daniel Vancini\nProduct Description\nSit back and enjoy all 17 episodes of the sixth season of the show that makes you laugh your @$$ off, now available for the first time in this exclusive 3-disc collectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s edition.

Simply put the DVD-R into your XBOX 360, then go to video library, current disc, and play an episode and if you do not already have the update it will direct you to the download page of it.

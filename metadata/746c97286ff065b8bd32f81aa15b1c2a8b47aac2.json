After a few days and nights of mysterious lights and noises, a giant machine comes out of the ocean. The machine is the creation of an alien race, that is trying to syphon energy from earth. A true classic, in that it is so different from anything in the time period. To this day, nothing else has come out like it. \n\n\nThis is another I saw as a very young kid. I didn't really understand the stealing of energy part at the time all that much, but I knew the sound it made when it was walking and that its feet stomped on people. Very scary.

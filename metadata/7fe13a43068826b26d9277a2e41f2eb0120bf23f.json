His music was a logical extension of his idol Jimmie Rodgers's style, and Snow's letter-perfect, prudently effective vocal delivery and crisp, tasteful acoustic-guitar runs graced countless (actually, 36) top 10 country hits. This 20-song collection provides a nice introduction to his various styles and captures all of his best-known songs. His own compositions &quot;I'm Movin' On&quot; and &quot;Rhumba Boogie&quot; plus covers like &quot;I've Been Everywhere&quot; and &quot;I Don't Hurt Anymore&quot; were not only hugely dominant hits (Shania wasn't the first Canadian country phenom), but they remain cornerstones of country. --Marc Greilsamer \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe13a43068826b26d9277a2e41f2eb0120bf23f","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Hank+Snow+%5B1997.192kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe13a43068826b26d9277a2e41f2eb0120bf23f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,225,58,67,6,136,38,178,109,146,119,162,228,31,46,176,18,11,242,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

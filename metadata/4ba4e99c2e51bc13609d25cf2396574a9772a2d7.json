No expense has been spared to obtain the oldest translations of the Bible, copies of the ancient manuscripts, and other facilities to make the revision as perfect as possible.\n\nThe paragraph form has been adopted in preference to the division by verse, which is a modern mode of division, never used in the ancient scriptures. But, for convenience of reference, the numbers of the verses are retained.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba4e99c2e51bc13609d25cf2396574a9772a2d7","amp;dn":"American+Bible+Union+Audiobible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba4e99c2e51bc13609d25cf2396574a9772a2d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,164,233,156,46,81,188,19,96,157,37,207,35,150,87,74,151,114,162,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

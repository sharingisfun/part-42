The heavy-weight processes of\nthe 1980s and 1990s are being replaced by light-weight, so called agile processes.\nAgile processes move the focus of software development back to what really\nmatters: running software. This is only made possible by accepting that software\ndevelopment is a creative job done by, with, and for individual human beings. For\nthis reason, agile software development encourages interaction, communication,\nand fun.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d95cd858f0ac62f722f19c38184b5c038454774","amp;dn":"Extreme+programming+and+agile+processes+in+software+engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d95cd858f0ac62f722f19c38184b5c038454774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,149,205,133,143,10,198,47,114,47,25,195,129,132,181,192,56,69,71,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

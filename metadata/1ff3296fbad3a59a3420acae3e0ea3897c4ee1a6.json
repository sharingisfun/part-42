Mullen has become one of the most loved and respected singer/songwriters in the Christian industry. Everyday People picks up right where the previous albums left off, offering a rang of worshipful songs from the danceable &quot;This, This&quot; to &quot;Redeemer&quot; like moments on &quot;I Am&quot;. Reoccurring throughout Everyday People is a theme about real people, fans that have left an impact on Nicole, friends dealing with abuse, issues like freedom, and how all these people reconcile with their creator. Nicole has tapped mainstream producers James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Wright (Mariah Carey, Yolanda Adams) of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis' Flyte Time Productions, as well as production duo Drew &amp; Shannon (Andrew Ramsey &amp; Shannon Sanders) (India Arie, Cindy Morgan, FFH) to expand the sonic palette, in addition to husband and long-time producer David Mullen and Tommy Sims. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff3296fbad3a59a3420acae3e0ea3897c4ee1a6","amp;dn":"Nicole+C+Mullen+-+2004+-+Everyday+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff3296fbad3a59a3420acae3e0ea3897c4ee1a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,243,41,111,186,211,165,154,52,32,172,174,62,14,163,137,124,78,225,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

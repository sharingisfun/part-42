Examples and applications were chosen for their relevance to real world problems, and where numerical solutions are most efficient. Numerical methods are discussed thoroughly and illustrated with problems involving both hand computation and programming. MATLAB mfiles accompany each method and are available on the book web site. This code is made simple and easy to understand by avoiding complex bookkeeping schemes, while maintaining the essential features of the method. MATLAB was chosen as the example language because of its ubiquitous use in engineering studies and practice. Moreover, it is widely available to students on school networks and through inexpensive educational versions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f85352b60f35fd6d2e9cce8fbc554b8c6b2b20","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+In+Engineering+With+MATLAB+-+Jaan+Kiusalaas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f85352b60f35fd6d2e9cce8fbc554b8c6b2b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,248,83,82,182,15,53,253,109,46,156,206,143,188,85,75,140,107,43,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

An example is Brazil which on it's own may have more road map detail than that included with the South America one. With the registry batch files included in each MapSource folder, you can pick and choose which to install - assuming you download them in the first place!\n\nEnjoy.\n\nP.S. If you know of locations to updated versions as of time of posting this torrent, please let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4dc6f3da275c2a0039b12e54cb64d3b39beb3b","amp;dn":"Garmin+City+Navigator+Maps+%28MapSource%29+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4dc6f3da275c2a0039b12e54cb64d3b39beb3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,77,198,243,218,39,92,42,0,57,177,46,84,203,100,211,179,155,235,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

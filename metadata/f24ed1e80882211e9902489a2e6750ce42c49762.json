He meets a lama, a holy man, and devotes himself to his tending. But when British administrators discover his birthright, he is placed in a British school. His nature, however, is opposed to the regimentation expected for the son of a British soldier, and he rebels. His familiarity with Indian life and his ability to pass as an Indian child allows him to function as a spy for the British as they attempt to thwart revolution and invasion of India. Rejoining his holy man, Kim (with the help of daring adventurer Mahbub Ali) takes on a dangerous mission. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042644/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042644/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo]\nResolution : 720x536 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 661 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,06 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24ed1e80882211e9902489a2e6750ce42c49762","amp;dn":"Kim+%281950%29+Errol+Flynn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24ed1e80882211e9902489a2e6750ce42c49762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,78,209,232,8,130,33,30,153,2,72,154,46,103,80,206,66,196,151,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

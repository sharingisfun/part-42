It is copied straight from the original disk. \n\nMedievil is one of the first games that included LibCrypt, an anti copy protection produced by Sony back in the day. Therefor, most of the isos that you will find on the internet, stop working after you finish level 3 (Cemetery Hill).\n\nYou can use any emulator to run the game.\n\nIf you want to burn the image onto a CD and put it in the original console, here is what you should do:\n\nDownload and install a burning program called &quot;Clone CD&quot; (it's not for free so you can just use the 3 week trial) and burn the image to a CD of your choice. It's pretty easy to do it because from all 4 files that is included in the torrent folder, Clone CD can select only one of them so it is very obvious.\n\nThis is the only program to burn a working CD for console play, because it makes an exact copy 1:1 of the game. Do not try it with any other burning software or it ill fail after level 3.\n\nEnjoy\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3062678d36d355b7864d2a1584b9a1cb6c6fc8e","amp;dn":"Medievil+1+%5BPAL%5D+PSX+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3062678d36d355b7864d2a1584b9a1cb6c6fc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,6,38,120,211,109,53,91,120,100,210,161,88,75,154,28,182,198,252,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-Seventies&quot;.[5] They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the globe's loudest band&quot; for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre,[6][7] and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide,[8][9][10][11] including 8 million certified units in the US.l &quot;\n\n\n\nDeep Purple in Concert 2001\n\n\nDeep Purple in Concert is an live album by the English hard rock band Deep Purple, recorded by the BBC for their &quot;In Concert&quot; live series in 1970 and 1972. First released in 1980 in the UK, with the current US edition being made available in 2001.\n\nThe first CD features the live recording from the BBC Studios in London on 19 February 1970; the band stepped in at the last minute for Joe Cocker, who cancelled his scheduled appearance. DJ John Peel introduced the tracks as they were performed. The second CD is the gig from 9 March 1972, this time with DJ Mike Harding as compere. The latter recording features the only known live recording of &quot;Never Before&quot; (it was out as a single at the time) and a rare Mk II offering of &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo&quot;. These two songs were played instead of the usual &quot;Child in Time&quot; to promote the new forthcoming album Machine Head, released at the end of that month (March, 1972).\n\n&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; (the first ever live performance) and &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo&quot; were not included on the original 2 LP vinyl release in 1980, although &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; was made available as a single release. The vinyl was housed in a gatefold-sleeve with photo-liners.\n\nThe track lengths on many of the 2001 reissues are incorrect. In 2004, the contents of the 2nd disc were remastered and released on SACD as Live on the BBC, on Audio Fidelity, with two bonus tracks (studio versions of &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;River Deep Mountain High&quot;). In 2012, the contents of the 2nd disc were remixed and released as In Concert '72, with the original set list in its correct order for the first time. \n\nTracks: \n\nCD 1 \n\n1. &quot;Speed King&quot; \n2. &quot;Child in Time&quot; \n3. &quot;Wring That Neck&quot; \n4. &quot;Mandrake Root&quot; \n\n\nCD 2 \n\n1. &quot;Highway Star&quot; \n2. &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot;  \n3. &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo&quot; \n4. &quot;Never Before&quot; \n5. &quot;Lazy&quot;  \n6. &quot;Space Truckin'&quot;  \n7. &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; \n8. &quot;Lucille&quot; \n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f60a974d951de9c91cec987942649a8ae29297","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+In+Concert+2001+%282CD%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f60a974d951de9c91cec987942649a8ae29297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,246,10,151,77,149,29,233,201,28,236,152,121,66,100,154,138,226,146,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

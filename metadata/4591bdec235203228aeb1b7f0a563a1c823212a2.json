Settlements were used from the beginning to create a Zionist foothold in Palestine.\n\nAfter 1967 and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the aim of the settlement movement became clear - create facts on the ground and make the creation of a Palestinian state impossible. Thirty nine years of occupation and the policy started showing results. There are now more than 200 settlements and outposts scattered throughout the West Bank blocking the geographic possibility of a contiguous Palestinian territory.\n\nThe Iron Wall documentary exposes this phenomenon and follows the timeline, size, population of the settlements, and its impact on the peace process. This film also touches on the latest project to make the settlements a permanent fact on the ground - the wall that Israel is building in the West Bank and its impact on the Palestinian's peoples.\n\nSettlements and related infrastructures are impacting every aspect of life for all Palestinians from land confiscation, theft of natural resources, confiscation of the basic human rights, creation of an apartheid-like system, to the devastating impact in regards to the future of the region and the prospect of the peace process.\n\nPalestinians and Israelis began the peace process based on a very simple principle: land for peace. Settlements destroy that principle and create a land with no peace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4591bdec235203228aeb1b7f0a563a1c823212a2","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Wall.+Pr.+Carter%2C+%27MUST+SEE%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4591bdec235203228aeb1b7f0a563a1c823212a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,145,189,236,35,82,3,34,138,235,27,127,10,86,58,28,130,50,18,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

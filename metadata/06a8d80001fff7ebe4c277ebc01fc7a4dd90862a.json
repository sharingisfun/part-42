For this is one of the many influences Lars and James grew up on, if you listen carefully to this album you can hear many little licks and riffs that sound similar to future Metallica albums.\nAlso after listening to Gary Lettice, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll almost swear its James Hetfield.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of doom or NWOBHM this album wont disappoint you. Particularly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a metallica fan who wants to discover something else. If I were ever going to recommend any Holocaust album it would be this one. Unfortunately the later albums were quite poor and lacked the enthusiasm of Ã¢â‚¬Å“NightcomersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Gary LetticeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absence may be a factor but the magic isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite there. Enjoy this one folks, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the debut and undeniably the best Holocaust album to date.\n&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a8d80001fff7ebe4c277ebc01fc7a4dd90862a","amp;dn":"+Holocaust+-+The+Nightcomers+2CD+%281981+NWOBHM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a8d80001fff7ebe4c277ebc01fc7a4dd90862a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,168,216,0,1,255,247,235,228,194,119,235,192,31,199,164,221,144,134,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

While Elliott's agreeably worn, leathery voice inhabits songs associated with the likes of Rev. Gary Davis and Blind Willie McTell with undeniable ease, producer Joe Henry puts a twist on the proceedings. \n\nWith a band that includes Van Dyke Parks, Los Lobos' David Hidalgo, and others, Henry adds just a bit of arch, modern sonic spin, providing a moody atmosphere that enhances the experience without overwhelming Elliott's performances.\n\nRamblin' Jack Elliott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar\nGreg Leisz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, dobro, mandolin, mandola, Weissenborn\nJay Bellerose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\nKeith Ciancia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano, keyboards\nVan Dyke Parks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano, vibraphone\nDavid Piltch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ upright bass\nDavid Hidalgo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, accordion\n\n01.&quot;Rising High Water Blues&quot; (Blind Lemon Jefferson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n02.&quot;Death Don't Have No Mercy&quot; (Reverend Gary Davis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08\n03.&quot;Rambler's Blues&quot; (Lonnie Johnson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14\n04.&quot;Soul of a Man&quot; (Blind Willie Johnson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:16\n05.&quot;Richland Women Blues&quot; (Mississippi John Hurt) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n06.&quot;Grinnin' in Your Face&quot; (Son House) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n07.&quot;New Stranger Blues&quot; (Tampa Red) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:25\n08.&quot;Falling Down Blues&quot; (Furry Lewis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53\n09.&quot;How Long Blues&quot; (Leroy Carr) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n10.&quot;Please Remember Me&quot; (Walter Davis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:03\n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b05b44aca69a7ec692db18e167c5e73b0aa916cd","amp;dn":"Ramblin%27+Jack+Elliott+-+A+Stranger+Here+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b05b44aca69a7ec692db18e167c5e73b0aa916cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,91,68,172,166,154,126,198,146,219,24,225,103,197,231,59,10,169,22,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

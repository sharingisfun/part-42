The first novel revealed how Walter Bishop and William Bell discovered the drug Cortexiphan--and the alternate universe! Book two will explore how Olivia Dunham first was subjected to Cortexiphan experiments, with catastrophic results.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34cfd9edf45e6f531f4b06a542fab31e3f82eaa7","amp;dn":"The+Burning+Man+by+Christa+Faust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34cfd9edf45e6f531f4b06a542fab31e3f82eaa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,207,217,237,244,94,111,83,31,75,6,165,66,250,179,30,63,130,234,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

While plotting their next studio album, the Southern California band enlisted some of aggro rock&amp;#039;s leading lights, as well as some of the more enlightened underground MCs and producers, to slice and dice all the songs on their debut (including a few bonus cuts that made it to their Japanese release). Linkin Park allowed their special guests--including Korn&amp;#039;s Jonathan Davis, Staind&amp;#039;s Aaron Lewis, Orgy&amp;#039;s Jay Gordon, the Roots&amp;#039; Black Thought, and Jurassic 5&amp;#039;s Chali 2NA--to run riot through their songbook, tweaking melodies, writing new lyrics, and sometimes changing the entire intent of the originals. As a result, this collection of 20 songs is Mr. Hyde to Hybrid Theory&amp;#039;s Dr. Jekyll. Most of Linkin Park&amp;#039;s atmospheric and melodic moments have ended on the cutting-room floor--along with the self-consciousness that pervaded many of the songs--replaced with a brash impudence that&amp;#039;s more rap than rock. Chali 2NA entirely changes the landscape on &quot;Forgotten,&quot; shape-shifting the song into an alien being dubbed &quot;Frgt/10,&quot; which takes you to a dark, desolate place with only your own disturbed thoughts and some electronic bleeps for company. And that&amp;#039;s enough. This is a masterful art project that truly succeeds. --Jaan Uhelszki --This text refers to the Audio CD edition.\n\nProduct Description\nThis is not just another remix album.

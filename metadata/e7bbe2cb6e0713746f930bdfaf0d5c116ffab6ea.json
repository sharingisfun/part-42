It was released in 2002 (see 2002 in music).\n\nAfter the album was released, in 2003 singer Gordon Downie released his second solo album of music and poetry, Battle of the Nudes.\n\nPackaged with the album in stores was a membership card for The Hip Club, an online fan club which offered three downloadable bonus tracks, &quot;Forest Edge&quot;, &quot;Problem Bears&quot; and &quot;Ultra Mundane&quot;. As of May 23, 2006, thehipclub.com is no longer active.\n\nThe album was produced by Hugh Padgham who has worked extensively with Phil Collins, The Police, Split Enz and Sting among others.\n\nThe music video for &quot;'It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken'&quot; was filmed in Oshawa, Ontario at Parkwood Estate. The light-hearted music video for &quot;The Darkest One&quot; featured Don Cherry and the Trailer Park Boys.\n\n&quot;All Tore Up&quot; is featured as menu music in XSN Sports' NHL Rivals 2004 for the Microsoft Xbox[1]. This marked the first time a Hip song was licensed for a video game.\n\nAll songs were written by The Tragically Hip.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Are You Ready&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39\n   2. &quot;Use it Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n   3. &quot;The Darkest One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n   4. &quot;'It's a Good Life if You Don't Weaken'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n   5. &quot;Silver Jet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n   6. &quot;Throwing off Glass&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n   7. &quot;All Tore Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n   8. &quot;Leave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n   9. &quot;A Beautiful Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n  10. &quot;The Dire Wolf&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n  11. &quot;The Dark Canuck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:24\n\n[edit] Singles\n\n    * &quot;'It's a Good Life if You Don't Weaken'&quot;\n    * &quot;The Darkest One&quot;\n    * &quot;Silver Jet&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7bbe2cb6e0713746f930bdfaf0d5c116ffab6ea","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+In+Violet+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7bbe2cb6e0713746f930bdfaf0d5c116ffab6ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,187,226,203,110,7,19,116,111,147,11,223,175,13,92,17,111,250,182,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

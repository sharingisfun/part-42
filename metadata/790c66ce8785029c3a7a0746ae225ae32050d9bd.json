However, her brother has his doubts, and calls in private investigator Cormoran Strike to look into the case.\n\nStrike is a war veteran - wounded both physically and psychologically - and his life is in disarray. The case gives him a financial lifeline, but it comes at a personal cost: the more he delves into the young model's complex world, the darker things get - and the closer he gets to terrible danger . . .\n\nA gripping, elegant mystery steeped in the atmosphere of London - from the hushed streets of Mayfair to the backstreet pubs of the East End to the bustle of Soho - The Cuckoo's Calling is a remarkable book. Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is a classic crime novel in the tradition of P. D. James and Ruth Rendell, and marks the beginning of a unique series of mysteries.\n\n\nBook format: PDF\n\nBook Cover:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8Afogo9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8Afogo9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:790c66ce8785029c3a7a0746ae225ae32050d9bd","amp;dn":"The+Cuckoo%27s+Calling+By+Robert+Galbraith%28aka+J.K+Rowling%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"790c66ce8785029c3a7a0746ae225ae32050d9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,12,102,206,135,133,2,156,58,122,7,70,174,34,90,227,32,80,217,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After decades of releasing relatively normal if not innovative fingerstyle acoustic tunes, he released this sound collage-influenced album, with special focus on the avant-garde. His experimental stuff, you dig. Most attribute the sudden change in style and theme to his ailing health, and his reliance on the collage aspects were pragmatic rather than artistic. I, myself, disagree. \n\nTracks one and three, &quot;Sharks&quot; and &quot;Eels&quot; respectively, are the two that sound most unlike his prior work. Either track sounds nothing like the work expected of Fahey. But, the final track, &quot;Juana,&quot; while unorthodox, is undeniably John Fahey. I would go so far as to say it is the logical conclusion of his body of work. All in all, a real killer album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c48a3bdbf342b43c2890a08b5b79ef0ef0d0ac","amp;dn":"John+Fahey+-+Womblife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c48a3bdbf342b43c2890a08b5b79ef0ef0d0ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,196,138,59,219,243,66,180,60,40,144,160,139,91,121,239,14,240,208,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Included on their second album, Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom, &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot; is a slow ballad written by Billie Rae Calvin and produced by Norman Whitfield. The lyrics concern a woman longing for the return of an ex-lover so that they can resume their relationship. The original version of &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot; was not a big hit, peaking at number 52 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. However, the song was a big chart hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number three in March 1978. The parent album, In Full Bloom, was also successful as a whole.\n      The Cover Girls recorded a hit cover of the song. The Cover Girls' version surpassed the success of the original, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where the original had failed to chart, and became the 49th best selling single of 1992 in America. It was also a hit in the UK, peaking at No. 38.\n      The single was re-released as the X Factor's charity single for 2011. The single features JLS &amp; One Direction.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07bf3921c432bd89f5951060e4b97dce5e72010","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+517","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07bf3921c432bd89f5951060e4b97dce5e72010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,123,243,146,28,67,43,216,159,89,81,6,14,75,151,220,229,231,32,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

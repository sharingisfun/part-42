From there, she artfully displayed other sides of her personality, from dismayed to defiant and assured. Her rendition of &quot;Soul On Fire&quot; was heartfelt, but didn't approach the majestic quality of Lavern Baker's original. She did much better on &quot;I Don't Want No Man,&quot; striking the air of disdain and dissatisfaction that Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland immortalized on &quot;I Don't Want No Woman&quot;; guitarist Kenny Ray even got the Wayne Bennett licks down perfectly.

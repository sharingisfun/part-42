His vision for unmatched success, which  is bringing the attention of Hip-Hop fans and industry alike, is balanced by his intense love for struggling communities and dream to elevate the spirits of other kids hoping to defeat hardships of the streets. Rather than express anger and frustration over the circumstance he faced as a youth, he serves as an example that crime and gang culture are not the only way out: positive attitude can defeat negativity at the end of the day. Watch out for Conrad, with his buzz, infectious songs and work ethic, he will be a force to be reckoned with for some time to come.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Intro Living Life\n02 Grindin\n03 Life Of The Party\n04 My Life\n05 My Music\n06 Lil Prayer\n07 Mama\n08 Love You Ft K.O.\n09 Beat It\n10 Like To Party\n11 Sam B\n12 Champain Gang\n13 No More\n14 Want Me\n15 Take You There\n16 Na Na Na\n\n\nFOLLOW @CONRADSWORLD @DJSKULLATOR @THEDJILLMATIC ON TWITTER\n\nContact:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4ac819681a28b96a5b68185978b8aa991978d87a4a389858d88ca878b89&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033740e7716dcf6a7426efbca2263ae38778f9aa","amp;dn":"Conrad+2012+Hosted+by+Tapestars+Dj+Illmatic+%26amp%3B+Dj+Skullator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033740e7716dcf6a7426efbca2263ae38778f9aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,55,64,231,113,109,207,106,116,38,239,188,162,38,58,227,135,120,249,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Kennedy appeared before a crowd  \n  in Fort Worth, Texas to honor the freedoms of America in what would   \n  be his final speech. Though the Zapruder film, a silent, 8mm home     \n  movie of the presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, is the      \n  most complete visual recording of JFK s assassination, it is just     \n  part of a vast record of sights and sounds captured on camera that    \n  day. This four-hour special from HISTORYTM uses unique, rarely seen   \n  and heard footage to document the Kennedy assassination and the       \n  nearly 50 years of speculation and controversy that changed America.  \n  Home movies from eyewitnesses, Dallas police dispatch radio           \n  recordings, and raw news footage provide a shocking, unflinching      \n  look at the assassination of the president and the days that          \n  followed while examining the aftermath, and the enduring              \n  controversies, that emerged as succeeding generations of Americans    \n  struggled to comprehend the sudden murder of an unforgettable leader. \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1523308/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1523308/&lt;/a&gt;                                  \n                                                                        \n  A bit old but excellent doco, enjoy!                                  \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e692a787d6c7b695e79737f7772307d7173&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba420d0621e9217405cfbed139b6d08fdfb6a4f","amp;dn":"JFK.3.Shots.That.Changed.America.Part2.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba420d0621e9217405cfbed139b6d08fdfb6a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,164,32,208,98,30,146,23,64,92,251,237,19,155,109,8,253,251,106,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

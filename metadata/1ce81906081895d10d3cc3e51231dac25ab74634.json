More nations now benefit from the triggered modifier.\nBourgogne and Moskva now have a higher base tax.\nHistorical Rivals added to further encourage historical growth.\nAdded more cores and a new mission for Muscovy.\nMuzaffarid Persia is now Sunni.\nThe Golden Horde now starts at war with some of it's neighbours, in the war against Chagatai for Mongol Hegemony.\n\n\n\nThe mod extends the start date back to the signing of Charles IV's Golden Bull - 1356! I have made every effort to ensure historical accuracy for this new period, however, if you notice anything wrong please do not hesitate to leave a comment. \n\nWhat you'll see: \n\n-A new start date of 25th December 1356 \n-New bookmarks: The Grand Campaign, The Queen in the North, The Ottoman Interregnum and The Treaty of Troyes. \n-A (hopefully) historically world Map \n-New countries and historical leaders for the period. \n-5 New tech levels, levels 6-13 of the Tech system overhauled, plus tweaked dates for all technologies to minimise Monarch Point waste. \n-Many fixed Vanilla History Files (countries, provinces, diplomacy, etc.) for the entire game period. \n-New Religions \n-Multiple event chains, including the Hussite Revolution and the forming of the Kalmar Union. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce81906081895d10d3cc3e51231dac25ab74634","amp;dn":"1356+-+A+Timeline+Extension+Mod+for+EUIV+8-9-14+updated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce81906081895d10d3cc3e51231dac25ab74634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,232,25,6,8,24,149,209,13,60,195,229,18,49,218,194,90,183,70,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

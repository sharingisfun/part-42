Its main goal is to give an overview of the subject but, unusual for a popular science book, it also attempts to explain some complex mathematics.\n\nThe author notes that an editor warned him that for every equation in the book the readership would be halved, hence it includes only a single equation: E = mc2. In addition to Hawking's notable abstention from presenting equations, the book also simplifies matters by means of illustrations throughout the text, depicting complex models and diagrams.\n\nThe book ends with: &quot;If we find [a unified theory], it would be the ultimate triumph ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for then we would know the mind of God.&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9a4ea295d748fddb7dde7e2ede49a906421971","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+Time+-+Stephen+Hawking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9a4ea295d748fddb7dde7e2ede49a906421971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,154,78,162,149,215,72,253,219,125,222,126,46,222,73,169,6,66,25,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

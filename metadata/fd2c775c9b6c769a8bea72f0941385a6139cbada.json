Apart from the soap opera parody \nDoctor Place in the &quot;Daytime Television&quot; monologue, which seems slow and \nterribly dated, and &quot;The Indian Sergeant&quot; (which is in a category by itself), \nany part of this record could have fit onto his subsequent FM &amp; AM. He rips \napart television commercials, AM radio, hippies, rock music, and other media \ntargets with the speed and spread pattern of a Gatling gun and the precision \nof a surgeon, and it's a statement about the nature of our popular culture \nthat a lot of the humor here holds up better, 30 years on, than some of \nCarlin's more iconoclastic work of the 1970s -- some of the momentary lapses \ninto gay stereotypes (i.e., Wendell the Witch) seem dated, though they were \non target at the time (almost openly gay Paul Lynde was a fixture throughout \nthe '60s and '70s on commercials and in series like Bewitched and The \nHollywood Squares). &quot;The Indian Sergeant&quot; is an inspired variation on military \nhumor that seems to be a direct offshoot of Carlin's stint in the army, and \nplays brilliantly in that spirit. Oddly enough, this routine has Carlin sounding a lot like his one-time partner Jack Burns, and all quite different from most of \nthe rest of this record. Most of it is amazingly fresh, as entertaining as \nCarlin's best work from the '70s, and all of it is a lot more accessible, if not as challenging or groundbreaking.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2c775c9b6c769a8bea72f0941385a6139cbada","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+-+Take-Offs+And+Put-Ons+%5B1967%5D+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2c775c9b6c769a8bea72f0941385a6139cbada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,44,119,92,155,108,118,154,139,234,114,240,148,19,133,166,19,156,186,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

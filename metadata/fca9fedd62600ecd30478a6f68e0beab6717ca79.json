She has remained true to her practice of a Vinyasa (flow)-based yoga that incorporates her background in dance and bodywork, as well as her own personal experience. In her teaching she emphasizes strength, intuition, fluidity, meditation, and wisdom in action. Her travels have taken her all over the globe to India, Africa, Nepal, Bali and the Caribean, and she is currently a faculty member at UCLA's Arts and Cultures Program, where she also received her Master's degree in dance movement therapy. With this interactive release filmed in beautiful regions of India and the Maldive Islands, students can select their favorite practices from a menu to put together a sequence that is specially tailored to their needs. Viewers can select from a variety of moving poses, meditations, and relaxations, and Shiva provides a list of suggested sequences of various lengths and levels of intensity.

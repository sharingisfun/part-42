To rescue her, Ryo\nand Robert must take on numerous enemies around South\nTown, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. Karate. The\npassion of the game's creators is evident in the unique\ngame-play elements introduced. These include an energy\ngauge that is depleted every time a fighter uses a\nspecial maneuver, Desperation Attacks that are usable\nonly when a fighter's health is low and camera zooming\nthat adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the\nstage. All these features ensure that players use\nstrategy and tactics, rather than simply mash buttons.\nAdding to the mix are little touches such as characters\nshowing cuts when they are injured and voice-over samples\nduring cut scenes. Can you perfect the art of fighting\nand save Yuri?\n\nList of Undumped Playstation Portable PSN Games\n\nWe are currently looking for suppliers of PSP PSN content.\nplayasia*hush*ai\n\nEUR (PSN Exclusives):\n\nBaseball Stars Professional (NeoGeo)\nClaDun x2\nFatal Fury (NeoGeo)\nLeague Bowling (NeoGeo)\nLegends of War: Patton's Campaign\nNeoGeo Heroes Ultimate Shooting\nNo Heroes Allowed!\nSamurai Shodown (NeoGeo)\nShock Troopers (NeoGeo)\nSuper Sidekicks (NeoGeo)\nSyphon Filter: Combat Ops\nThe King of Fighters '96 (NeoGeo)\n\nJPN (PSN Exclusives):\n\nKing of Pool\nNozomi Kanaetamae: Daydream Reconstruct\n\nJPN (PSN Exclusives - PCEngine titles):\n\nAlien Crush\nBattle Ace\nChiki Chiki Boys\nDouble Dungeons\nDungeon Explorer\nDungeon Explorer II\nKaizou Chounin Shubibinman\nKaizou Chounin Shubibinman 2: Atanaru Teki\nKaizou Chounin Shubibinman 3: Ikai No Princess\nMoto Roader II\nPower League 4\nPower Sports\nSengoku Mahjong\nSuper Star Soldier\nTakahashi Meijin No Shin Bouken Jima\nThe Kung Fu\nVictory Run: Eikou No 13,000KM\n\nJPN (PlayView for Games - Digital Strategy Guides):\n\nIrem Bururun Digital Magazine\n\nJPN (PSN Exclusives - BeitHell 2000):\n\nFeeling Partner 5 vs 5 (redeemable)\nWorld Clock Deluxe (redeemable)\n2 more unknown redeemable games\n\ndeest remedii locus, ubi, quae vitia fuerunt, mores fiunt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7408c92ecd402637514ae35ec88b475d9eafcf94","amp;dn":"Art_of_Fighting_EUR_PSN_PSP-PLAYASiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7408c92ecd402637514ae35ec88b475d9eafcf94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,8,201,46,205,64,38,55,81,74,227,94,200,139,71,93,158,175,207,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

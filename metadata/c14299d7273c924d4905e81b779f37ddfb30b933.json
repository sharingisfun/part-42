Sherman Klump (Murphy) is a college professor and respected biochemistry researcher who is kind, considerate, and a genuinely nice guy. Sherman is also appallingly overweight; coupled with the fact that he\\'s painfully shy and a bit clumsy, his romantic prospects are rather bleak. When Sherman finds himself working with a pretty graduate student, Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), he falls in love and is eager to impress her, but at an upscale nightclub, his weight attracts the attention of an insult comic (Dave Chappelle) and his bumbling spoils the evening. Sherman\\'s latest project is a genetic weight loss formula, and despondent over his failure to win Carla\\'s heart, he subjects himself to a massive dose. Suddenly, Sherman is transformed into the slim, trim, and handsome Buddy Love; however, the drug also boosts his testosterone level, turning the likable Sherman into the arrogant, skirt-chasing Buddy. In addition to playing Sherman and Buddy, Eddie Murphy also plays four other members of the porcine Klump family, as well as eccentric exercise guru Lance Perkins. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 36 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 336\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 110kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c14299d7273c924d4905e81b779f37ddfb30b933","amp;dn":"The+Nutty+Professor%281996%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c14299d7273c924d4905e81b779f37ddfb30b933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,66,153,215,39,60,146,77,73,5,232,27,119,159,55,221,251,48,185,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

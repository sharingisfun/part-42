This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41dfa56875b72e0324e2eda6ff4af630543be7b8","amp;dn":"Star.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S02E13.360p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41dfa56875b72e0324e2eda6ff4af630543be7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,223,165,104,117,183,46,3,36,226,237,166,255,74,246,48,84,59,231,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

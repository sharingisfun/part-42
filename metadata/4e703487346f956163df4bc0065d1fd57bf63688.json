It also works the other way around, you can use your tablet as a controller for your phone or a phone as a controller for another phone etc.\n\nControllers are fully customizable and you can build your own controllers as well as submit them to Droidbean for others to download. Please send us your own creations using the submission button inside the app and we will review and add them to the controller download section.\n\n    As of v1.33 you can now add analog joysticks to controllers. \n    If the emulator supports it, you can use full analog mode (360 degree rotation with sensitivity / strength based on distance from centre). Currently this includes any mupen based N64 emulator (Eg: Mupen64PLus, AE)\n    Multiplayer support is also possible if the emulator supports it. You must connect additional devices using the connect button from the new controller and not from the host device.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n    Controller builder / editor\n    Download custom controllers\n    Joystick support\n    All hardware keys from controller are sent to host so you can control volume etc.\n\nYou can check out more instructional videos on our website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/droidbean/btcontroller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/droidbean/btcontroller&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease Note: BT Controller only works with emulators and games that support custom input configurations.\n\nIf you experience slow performance, please ensure all other bluetooth accessories are turned off or disconnected as they may interfere.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 4, 2012)\n\n    Multiplayer support (Additional controllers must connect to the host)\n    Custom joystick codes (double tap joystick tile in edit mode)\n    Full btcontroller keyboard on host\n    Reset helper screens in settings\n    Controler Builder: Button to assign all remaining tile keycodes\n    Corrected Joystick resizing for different screens\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.0.1+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e703487346f956163df4bc0065d1fd57bf63688","amp;dn":"BT+Controller+v1.4+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e703487346f956163df4bc0065d1fd57bf63688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,112,52,135,52,111,149,97,99,223,75,192,6,93,31,213,123,246,54,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

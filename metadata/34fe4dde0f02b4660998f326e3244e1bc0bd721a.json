In this short and easy-to-read book, Dr. Phillip K. Peterson explains the ten rules of internal medicine. Using real case examples he shows how following the rules will help consumers make good decisions about their medical care.\n\nGet Inside Your DoctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Head provides advice about such questions as when to seek treatment, when to get another opinion, and when to let time take its course. Turn to the Ten Rules when you are weighing your doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recommendations about diagnostic tests and treatments and use them to communicate more effectively with your doctor. \n\nAs with all rules, the Ten Rules of Internal Medicine have occasional exceptionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and when evidence suggests that you are an exception, the relevant rule should be broken. Follow the Ten Rules to make decisions in the increasingly complicated medical world when you need guidance about health matters for yourself and your loved ones.\n\nMeet the Author:\nPhillip K. Peterson, M.D., is a professor of medicine and an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

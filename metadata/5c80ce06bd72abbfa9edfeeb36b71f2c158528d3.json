Gordon puts\n      the restaurants through a gruelling series of tests to determine\n      who's really got what it takes to hit the big time in the\n      restaurant world. Then Gordon descends on the two remaining\n      restaurants with a coach full of demanding diners. Finally, he\n      throws the restaurants into the toughest culinary environment of\n      all, inviting them to his flagship three-Michelin-starred\n      restaurant, Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, to cook the dish of\n      their lives for a group of specially invited guests. Ego, pride\n      and reputation: for the chefs, owners and their friends and\n      family, everything is on the line.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n                                                      \n       We're currently looking for :-                                \n                                                                     \n      A 10mbit+ box on a private line to use as a grp dump,         \n       exclusively for grp use.                                      \n                                                                     \n      Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED and NO .US!                       \n                                                                     \n      UK PDTV/HDTV cappers.                                         \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      If you're a P2P retard don't even bother emailing us, because \n       we WILL hurl abuse at you.

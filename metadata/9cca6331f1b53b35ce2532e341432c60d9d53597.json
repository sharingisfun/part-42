In a climate where the majority of table olives eaten by Australians are imported, real opportunities exist for a domestic table olive industry. Attention to quality and safety will ensure that Australian table olive producers are in a position to tackle and make inroads into the international export market. \n\nThe aim of this manual is to provide olive growers and processors with internationally based guidelines for ensuring the quality and safety of processed table olives. This manual covers all aspects essential for the production of safe, nutritious and marketable table olives including site selection, recommended varieties, pest and disease control, primary and secondary processing, and quality and safety testing. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cca6331f1b53b35ce2532e341432c60d9d53597","amp;dn":"Producing+Table+Olives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cca6331f1b53b35ce2532e341432c60d9d53597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,202,99,49,241,181,59,53,206,37,50,227,65,67,44,96,217,213,53,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Perhaps that's why his songs have been covered by everyone from Elvis (this set's &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;) to Dylan. If there's such a thing as an alpha-male folkie, Lightfoot certainly fits the bill. Spanning the\ntongue-in-cheek chauvinism of 1965's &quot;For Lovin' Me&quot; and the cheatin' ways of &quot;Sundown&quot; to more introspective fare like &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; and &quot;Beautiful,&quot; this 20-track collection presents a concise primer on Lightfoot's career and craft. After his career peaked with one of the most unlikely top five hits ever, the gloom-laden 1976 narrative &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,&quot; Lightfoot's production tailed off sharply, though this anthology's &quot;Stay Loose&quot; ('86) and &quot;Restless&quot; ('93) are testament to his enduring skills as a songwriter\nand performer. --Jerry McCulley\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Early morning rain                                   [03:07]\n02.For lovin' me                                        [02:28]\n03.Go-Go round                                          [02:41]\n04.Canadian railroad trilogy                            [06:22]\n05.Pussywillows, cat-Tails                              [02:51]\n06.Bitter green                                         [02:45]\n07.If you could read my mind                            [03:50]\n08.Summer side of life                                  [04:05]\n09.Cotton jenny                                         [03:26]\n10.Beautiful                                            [03:24]\n11.Sundown                                              [03:40]\n12.Carefree highway                                     [03:44]\n13.Rainy day people                                     [02:50]\n14.The wreck of the edmund fitzgerald                   [06:30]\n15.Race among the ruins                                 [03:21]\n16.Daylight katy                                        [04:20]\n17.The circle is small                                  [04:00]\n18.Baby step back                                       [03:56]\n19.Stay loose                                           [03:56]\n20.Restless                                             [03:36]\n____\n\n74:52 min\n106,2 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7389d2413462ff7cce60e2d5114d32589711d5","amp;dn":"Gordon_Lightfoot-Complete_Greatest_Hits-%28Retail%29-2002-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7389d2413462ff7cce60e2d5114d32589711d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,115,137,210,65,52,98,255,124,206,96,226,213,17,77,50,88,151,17,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

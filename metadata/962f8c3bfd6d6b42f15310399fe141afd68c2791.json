Recommended listening with either headphones or very good speakers.\n\nThere are three stages to NREM:\n\nStage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves having a frequency of 8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ13 Hz (common in the awake state) to theta waves having a frequency of 4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ7 Hz. This stage is sometimes referred to as somnolence or drowsy sleep. Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks, also known as positive myoclonus, may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1. Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage. During N1, the subject loses some muscle tone and most conscious awareness of the external environment.\n\nStage N2 is characterized by sleep spindles ranging from 11 to 16 Hz (most commonly 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14 Hz) and K-complexes. During this stage, muscular activity as measured by EMG decreases, and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears. This stage occupies 45Ã¢â‚¬â€œ55% of total sleep in adults.\n\nStage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) is characterized by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 Hz and having a peak-to-peak amplitude &gt;75 ÃŽÂ¼V. (EEG standards define delta waves to be from 0 to 4 Hz, but sleep standards in both the original R&amp;K, as well as the new 2007 AASM guidelines have a range of 0.5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 Hz.) This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3.\n\n1.Stage N1 11:47\n2.Stage N2 08:28\n3.Stage N3 11:55\n\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962f8c3bfd6d6b42f15310399fe141afd68c2791","amp;dn":"Invisible+Hands+-+Non-Rapid+Eye+Movement+Sleep+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962f8c3bfd6d6b42f15310399fe141afd68c2791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,47,140,59,253,109,107,66,241,83,16,57,159,225,65,175,214,140,39,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

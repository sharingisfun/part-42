It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30791d11c7e751c99b4e244708d79da061dfb9d3","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30791d11c7e751c99b4e244708d79da061dfb9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,121,29,17,199,231,81,201,155,78,36,71,8,215,157,160,97,223,185,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

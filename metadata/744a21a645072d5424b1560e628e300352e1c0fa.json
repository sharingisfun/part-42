Her husband wasnâ€™t as fortunate; he succumbed to Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma when he was only 45 after a regimen of doctor-prescribed chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants. Her personal experience led her to realize the many ways in which nutrition and lifestyle affect our ability to deal with health challenges. \r\nIn Cancer Hacks, Goodman has put together a comprehensive plan designed to offer some common-sense, natural and holistic advice to deal with the fear and uncertainty so many people face when confronted by this terrible disease. The various â€œhacksâ€ described in the book are intended to help those dealing with cancer, or those whose loved ones may be facing the battle. Her suggestions are practical and easily incorporated into day-to-day living. \r\nAlso included is a 7-day cleanse regimen for those looking to reset their bodies and refocus their energies on a fuller and healthier lifestyle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:744a21a645072d5424b1560e628e300352e1c0fa","amp;dn":"Cancer+Hacks%3A+A+Holistic+Guide+to+Overcoming+your+Fears+and+Heal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"744a21a645072d5424b1560e628e300352e1c0fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,74,33,166,69,7,45,84,36,177,86,14,98,142,48,3,82,225,192,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

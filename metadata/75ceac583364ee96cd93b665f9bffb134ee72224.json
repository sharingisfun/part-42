Unfortunately, dealing withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and attempting to overcomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the forces of evil is a pervasive problem in the real world as well.\n\nExplaining Evil addresses incidents of evil from ancient times to modern day around the globe. Concepts of evil within the big three religionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Christianity, Judaism, and IslamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are examined, as well as in Chinese philosophy and Native American beliefs. The political or national expressions of evil are explored, such as the &quot;axis of evil&quot; that culminated in World War II. These volumes identify the causes and effects of evil, and suggest possible remedies to humanity's inescapable flaw.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1003 pages\n# Publisher: Praeger (February 18, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 031338715X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313387159","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ceac583364ee96cd93b665f9bffb134ee72224","amp;dn":"Explaining+Evil+%283+Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ceac583364ee96cd93b665f9bffb134ee72224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,206,172,88,51,100,238,150,205,147,182,101,249,191,251,19,78,231,34,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

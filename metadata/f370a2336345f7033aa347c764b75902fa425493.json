DvorÃƒÂ¡k is considered one of the major figures of nationalism, both proselytizing for and making actual use of folk influences, which he expertly combined with Classical forms in works of all genres. His symphonies are among his most widely appreciated works; the Symphony No. 9 (&quot;From the New World,&quot; 1893) takes a place among the finest and most popular examples of the symphonic literature.

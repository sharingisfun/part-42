Noticing that it selects two songs from one of the best-selling records of all time tells you right off how pointless this is; it's a disservice to Pink Floyd and an insult to their fans. Another smack to both band and fan is the inclusion of the well-titled &quot;Embryo,&quot; a half-realized demo that was allegedly included on the Harvest label's Picnic compilation from 1970 by accident to begin with. Aside from &quot;Embryo,&quot; there isn't anything offered here that a major fan doesn't have. Alternately, someone who doesn't know any better and picks this up as their first Pink Floyd disc is going to get a poor summation of what they did prior to 1975's Wish You Were Here, along with a selection that makes for a bumpy ride. While &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot; showcase the band's early brilliance and &quot;One of These Days&quot; (off Meddle) and &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; (off A Saucerful of Secrets) are good examples of their more experimental side, the remainder seems scattershot, as if the catalog department threw darts at a giant corkboard listing the band's songs. You'd get a better introduction by shutting your eyes and purchasing the first thing you grab from the bin that isn't Works or anything from The Final Cut on. Better yet, start with The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and work your way through chronologically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c3461bf165a503a10e8708bb2fe1442be795b3","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Works+%281983%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c3461bf165a503a10e8708bb2fe1442be795b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,195,70,27,241,101,165,3,161,14,135,8,187,47,225,68,43,231,149,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Not only was their triple-guitar howl one of the definitive sounds of the whole post-Allmans movement, singer Ronnie Van Zant put his smarts--and his intelligence--to work on lyrics like &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot; (an anti-gun screed), &quot;Workin' for MCA&quot; (a not-grinning shot at the band's record label), and &quot;That Smell&quot; (a warning about his own excesses). And\nwhat's that other song called? Oh yeah, &quot;Free Bird.&quot; --Rickey Wright\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Sweet home alabama                                   [04:44]\n02.Swamp music                                          [03:32]\n03.I ain't the one                                      [03:53]\n04.Gimme three steps                                    [04:28]\n05.Double trouble (outtake version)                     [02:52]\n06.Free bird (outtake version)                          [10:08]\n07.Truck drivin' man                                    [05:18]\n08.Saturday night special                               [05:09]\n09.Workin' for MCA                                      [04:45]\n10.What's your name                                     [03:32]\n11.That smell                                           [05:48]\n12.Don't ask me no questions                            [03:25]\n13.Call me the breeze                                   [05:08]\n____\n\n62:42 min\n 91,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f59eeb1f297c33389003253a39cbfa3cccd914","amp;dn":"Lynyrd_Skynyrd-Skynyrds_Innyrds-%28Retail%29-1989-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f59eeb1f297c33389003253a39cbfa3cccd914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,245,158,235,31,41,124,51,56,144,3,37,58,57,203,250,60,204,217,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

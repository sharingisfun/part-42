Markie drums, percussion, washboard\nJohn Andrews lap steel guitar, dobro\nDanny Beirne piano, organ\n\nCarrying on in the tradition of Molly Hatchet and Blackfoot, their music is little bluesy with twang of country-style boogie, but at its core it's hard as nails. Their first album introduces a rich blend of piano, harmonica and the accompanying acoustic guitar that together form a solid southern rock sound. From the opening riff to closing song this album burns with captivating sense of danger. Blood Money and Rose Thorn Bed are highlights, but all of them are of equal caliber.\n\n01.

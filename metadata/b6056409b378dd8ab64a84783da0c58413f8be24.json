This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe Human League debuts their song &quot;Don't You Want Me&quot; (at number 39) and Paul McCartney &amp; Stevie Wonder debut their new duet &quot;Ebony &amp; Ivory&quot; on the hot 100 all the way up at number 29.\n\nA listener wants to know if any song has hit the top 40 in each of the last three decades; the 60's, the 70's, and the 80's. Casey lists the top five, one of which is &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; which would also be a hit for Gloria Estefan in 1995.\n\nCasey tells about the recording act that holds the record for longest streak in the top 40. This milk-drinking fellow stayed in for 169 straight weeks.\n\nSince Bob and Doug McKenzie are at number 19 with their comedy bit &quot;Take Off&quot; Casey lists the ten comedy acts that have hit the top 40 in the rock era, two of which made the top 10.\n\nAnother listener asks, &quot;What is the biggest number ever mentioned in the title of a hit song?&quot; Casey lists some of the &quot;big number&quot; song titles that I'm sure I have never heard on any radio.\n\nI didn't get my usual radio station this week. There are edits in segments 5 (&quot;Centerfold&quot; by the J. Geils Band, 9 (&quot;Nobody Said It Was Easy&quot; by Larue), and 13 (&quot;Key Largo&quot; by Bernie Higgins). In each song the tone changes for about 30 seconds.\n\nLW#3: We Got The Beat - The Go Go's\nLW#2: Open Arms - Journey\nLW#1: I Love Rock And Roll - Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts\n40: The Other Woman - Ray Parker, Jr\n39: Don't You Want Me - The Human League\n38: Hang Fire - The Rolling Stones\n37: Genius Of Love - The Tom Tom Club\n36: Theme From &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; - Mike Post\n35: Pop Goes The Movies (Part 1) - Meco\n34: The Beatles Movie Medley - The Beatles\n33: Mama Used To Say - Junior\n32: Bobbi Sue - The Oak Ridge Boys\n31: Centerfold - J.

They have taken against her and their lack of respect her is starting to show in the classroom. Claudenia must decide whether a confrontation is the best solution. As the term ends, she begins to question whether teaching was the right choice of career.\n\nMaths teacher Nick has taken on a life-skills lesson, which means he must explain about the birds and the bees to his impressionable year 7 pupils. Unluckily for them, Mr Church knows nothing about the topic so has to draw on fellow trainee Meryl for back-up.\n\nAt Lanfranc school in Croydon, a fight outside the school has serious consequences for one of Charles's pupils.\n\nFirst broadcast\nBBC Three, 9:00PM Thu, 6 Feb 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8b3c5884ccd4586f5ece8dd65a546bd9d5d5dc6","amp;dn":"Tough+young+teachers+s01e05.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8b3c5884ccd4586f5ece8dd65a546bd9d5d5dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,179,197,136,76,205,69,134,245,236,232,221,101,165,70,189,157,93,93,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In the time of Mexican rule, he secured a giant land grant and built a farming empire called New Helvetia, before gold was discovered and his land was overrun by gold-diggers.\n\nThe movie plays with the facts for added drama - thus Sutter flees Europe out of political idealism rather than to escape bad debts. It works very nicely as entertainment and \n\nkeeps you on the edge of your seat - the producers went all out to make this a lavish production. And how many Nazi westerns do you get to see anyway?\n\nI fitted the subtitles to the movie myself, they should synchronize properly now. In mp4 format.\n\nI have reseeded this after the the old torrent died. Please reseed generously.\tThis is the third try - it should work this time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e76fc6ae23e1c1fee9d25c43e08233bc583b76","amp;dn":"The+Emperor+of+California+%281936%29+John+Sutter+Eng.+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e76fc6ae23e1c1fee9d25c43e08233bc583b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,231,111,198,174,35,225,193,254,233,210,92,67,224,130,51,188,88,59,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

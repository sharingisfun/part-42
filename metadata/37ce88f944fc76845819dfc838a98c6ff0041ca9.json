Set in the 20th century, TIMBER WOLF is a hard-hitting action-adventure story about our hero's encounter with Thrust, a new character with a major streak of ultra-violence! You'll also meet Point Force, a government-sanctioned group of paranormals, who can't, at first, decide whether to incarcerate Timber Wolf or recruit him.\n\nThanks goes to DobisP.R. for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ce88f944fc76845819dfc838a98c6ff0041ca9","amp;dn":"Timber+Wolf+1-5+%281992-1993%29+%28DobisP.R.-Novus-HD%29+%5BNVS-D%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ce88f944fc76845819dfc838a98c6ff0041ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,206,136,249,68,252,118,132,88,25,223,200,56,169,140,111,240,4,28,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

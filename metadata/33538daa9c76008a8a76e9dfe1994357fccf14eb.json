(1997)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nAs the title suggests, Have I Offended Someone? contains all of Zappa's notoriously tasteless parodies and satires, from &quot;Bobby Brown Goes Down,&quot; &quot;Catholic Girls,&quot; and &quot;Jewish Princess&quot; to &quot;He's So Gay,&quot; &quot;Titties 'n Beer,&quot; and &quot;Dinah-Moe Humm.&quot; Nearly all of the tracks are presented in new remixed versions, and two songs, &quot;Dumb All Over&quot; and &quot;Tinsel Town Rebellion,&quot; have never been released before. Tinkering with the sound of the songs doesn't change their impact at all -- this is the material that made Zappa into an adolescent favorite during the late '70s and early '80s and, in a sense, that makes Have I Offended Someone? a best-of collection, even though only &quot;Valley Girl&quot; was a hit. In other words, for some Zappa fans, this collection is everything they loved about him, and for most of his detractors, it's everything they always hated about him. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.73% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRykodisc\nCatalog:\t\tRCD 10577\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Bobby Brown Goes Down\n02.Disco Boy\n03.Goblin Girl\n04.In France\n05.He's So Gay\n06.SEX\n07.Titties 'N Beer\n08.We're Turning Again\n09.Dumb All Over\n10.Catholic Girls\n11.Dinah-Moe Humm\n12.Tinsel Town Rebellion\n13.Valley Girl\nPrincess\n15.Yo Cats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33538daa9c76008a8a76e9dfe1994357fccf14eb","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Have+I+Offended+Someone%3F+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33538daa9c76008a8a76e9dfe1994357fccf14eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,83,141,170,156,118,0,138,138,118,233,223,225,153,67,87,252,207,20,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

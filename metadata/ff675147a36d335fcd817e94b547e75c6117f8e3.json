Read by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward\n\n{In The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that belief in a personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence. He is sympathetic to Robert Pirsig's observation in Lila that &quot;when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion.&quot; } http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion\n\nI have merged this whole audiobook into one single 7hours+ audio file for ease of use with music plays.

It is very impressive the range of topics covered in this relatively brief presentation. While the audio format allows greater clarity when explaining tone of voice and voice stress issues, for those that are more visual, I strongly suggest taking notes. This audio book offers great ideas toward helping you communicate whatever it is you want to say. Some of the topics covered include matching your sensory style to your audience, preventing reflex arguments, making your voice more pleasing (without spending considerable time or money), giving feedback (positive and negative) in a way it will be best received, and, of course, disarming verbal attacks (without pissing off your attacker).\n\nSummary: learn to spar verbally with peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦not worth sparring with\nRating: 2\n\ni found the book interesting enough to give a few hours toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦because ElginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really studied this carefully, but what really struck me loud and clear as i read on is that she misses the most OBVIOUS (and most emotionally healthy, or martically artistic) option for how to deal with verbally aggressive/abusive people: TO GET AWAY FROM THEM! (and she forgets that SAYING NOTHINGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦i.e. not engagingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦is a form of verbal communication too.) the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpresuppositionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (she loves that word) she completely misses is that people donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always HAVE to stay (stuck) in verbally abusive relationships, and she never really suggests, either subtly or overtly, that people can leave. her basic unspoken assumption is that you should stay and learn how to spar better verbally so as not to be verbally taken advantage of and trampled. (rather a conservative point of view for a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmodernÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feminist, wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you say?)\n\none other thing that irked me: she often suggests that in times of real emotional attack the best verbal mode to enter into is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcomputerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mode. psychologically, what sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suggesting is to pull oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotions out of the interactionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦to basically emotionally detach from the situationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and become an analytical computer that lacks a self. the people who have really mastered this art into the marrow of their personalities have earned a label in psychology: that of schizoid personality disorder.\n\ni hate to say it, but i think this book is really a big crock, and while i did find parts of it engaging, as i think analyzing interactions to be fascinating, as a self-help book, which is really what it is, i found it to be USELESS!\n\nother gripe: she makes FAR TOO MANY stereotypes about menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s patterns of verbal interaction, and while she makes occasional attempts to demonstrate that such stereotypes are not always so, she still regularly falls back into them, suggesting she has an emotional bone to pick of her own.\n\nand finally, a saying i love, that applies here: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t argue with idiotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll drag you down to their level and beat you with experienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSummary: Audio presentation offers something the written page doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nRating: 5\n\nFor those familiar with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGentle ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series this audio offers an added dimension in understanding and incorporating the skills of gentle art communication into your own vocabularly. An essential part of the Gentle Art communication skills are tone of voice and stresses that are placed on each word and this audio is exceptionally helpful in demonstrating the content that is being discussed. It will also serve as an excellent introduction to the material for anyone who enjoys audio books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332e4c9ad15c5782a43b011861f24c8982d79f6a","amp;dn":"Mastering+the+Gentle+Art+of+Verbal+Self-Defense","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332e4c9ad15c5782a43b011861f24c8982d79f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,46,76,154,209,92,87,130,164,59,1,24,97,242,76,137,130,215,159,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Here, Barron performs a variety of songs from the late Johnny Alf, as well as composer/harmonica player Mauricio Einhorn, who also joins Barron on the album. Also joining Barron are such luminaries as trumpeter Claudio Roditi, saxophonist Idriss Boudrioua, drummer Rafael Barata, guitarist Lula Galvao, bassist Sergio Barrozo, and keyboardist Alberto Chimelli.

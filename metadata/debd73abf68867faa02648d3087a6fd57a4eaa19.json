Dragon Door published the best-selling Convict Conditioning books, and is considered an industry leader in fitness certifications. Progressive calisthenics, the training approach to strength in Convict Conditioning, is also at the center of Dragon Door's latest instructor certification. Progressive calisthenics have been my latest fitness obsession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ minimalist training that needs little to no equipment, yet reaps huge rewards. There are details on the progressive calisthenics workshops in the catalog, as well as free articles. There are quite a few incredible training books, e-books, DVD's, and more available in the catalog, as well! The Convict Conditioning books, DVD's, and Ultimate Bodyweight Training Log are among the varied selection.\n\nTo read my free article that details progressive calisthenics for strength, head to my blog post -\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/2012/09/progressive-calisthenics-for-strength.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/2012/09/progressive-calisthenics-for-strength.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:debd73abf68867faa02648d3087a6fd57a4eaa19","amp;dn":"Dragon+Door+-+Free+Fitness+Catalog+PDF+%28webseed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"debd73abf68867faa02648d3087a6fd57a4eaa19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,189,115,171,246,136,103,250,160,38,72,211,8,122,111,213,122,78,170,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

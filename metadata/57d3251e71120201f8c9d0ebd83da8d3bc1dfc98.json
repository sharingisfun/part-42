The Musical is now a small cult classic \nthanks to DVD. It deserves more because this is \nsimply a great movie, with songs that will leave you \nlaughing for days and some great pop-culture \nreferences. Oh yeah, and Japanese Indians. And \nConfederate solider Cyclopses.\n\nI actually read about the real Alfred Packer on \nthe internet and believe it or not, the movie stays \ntrue to what happened. Scary, huh?\n\nHistorical background aside, the one-liners and \nmusical numbers (`Let&amp;#039;s Build a Snowman&amp;#039; is \nunbelievably funny) are a good reason to get this \nmovie. If you have a DVD player, get the DVD and \nlisten to the cast/crew&amp;#039;s drunk commentary. It&amp;#039;s \nnot very informative but it sure is fun.&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nRipper&amp;#039;s Notes\n\n\nI saw crappy ~600 meg rips floating around the net\nwith this beauty, and I thought it was worth doing\na rip scene-style. Instead of doing the ordinary\nprocedure I decided to include the director&amp;#039;s\ncomments track also, since they&amp;#039;re pretty funny.\nInstead of sounding important, Trey Parker and\nhis friends from the movie is drinking beer while\ncommenting the stuff on the screen xD\n\n// AssMaster @ The Pirate Bay\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d3251e71120201f8c9d0ebd83da8d3bc1dfc98","amp;dn":"Cannibal.The.Musical.1996.Dual.Audio.iNTERNAL.DVDRip.XViD-AssMas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d3251e71120201f8c9d0ebd83da8d3bc1dfc98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,211,37,30,113,18,2,1,248,201,208,235,216,61,168,211,188,29,252,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

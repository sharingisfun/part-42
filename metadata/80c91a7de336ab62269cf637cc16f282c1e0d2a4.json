This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nI am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system and proper loudspeakers.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nMany of movies I encode have embedded or external  subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c91a7de336ab62269cf637cc16f282c1e0d2a4","amp;dn":"South.Park.S14E03.272p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c91a7de336ab62269cf637cc16f282c1e0d2a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,201,26,125,227,54,171,98,38,156,246,55,204,22,242,130,193,224,210,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

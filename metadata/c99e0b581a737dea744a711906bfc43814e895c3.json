One such process is continuum percolation, which is used when the phenomenon being modeled is made up of individual events that overlap e.g., individual raindrops that eventually make the ground evenly wet. This is a systematic, rigorous account of continuum percolation. The authors treat two models, the Boolean model and the random connection model, in detail, and they discuss related continuum models. Meester and Roy explain all important techniques and methods and apply them to obtain results on the existence of phase transitions, equality and continuity of critical densities, compressions, rarefaction, and other aspects of continuum models.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c99e0b581a737dea744a711906bfc43814e895c3","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1996%5D+Continuum+Percolation+%28Cambridge+Tracts+in+Mathema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c99e0b581a737dea744a711906bfc43814e895c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,158,11,88,26,115,125,234,116,74,113,25,6,191,196,56,20,232,149,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

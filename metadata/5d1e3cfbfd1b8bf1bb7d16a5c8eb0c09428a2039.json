This makes sense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both are essentially instrumental and neither sweats the structure enough to be called a proper album. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about where the affinity ends. El-PÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aesthetic is almost the opposite of DillaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freewheeling sonic-scavenger approach to production: he goes for depth, not breadth, refining a static consciousness instead of letting it stream. The consciousness is the same one heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been developing since Company Flow, a thump-and-skitter cityscape of new-age paranoia, a Blade Runner-inflected jumble of signifiers that have gotten rusty but are no less ominous for it.\n\nWeareallgoingtoburninhell gets that consciousness across as cleanly and purely as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re likely to ever hear from El, foremost because nobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rhyming. On one hand, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing; verbal clarity has never been his intent or forte, and his dark wit comes across amply in his choice of sounds, his rhythmic gestures, his song titles. On the other hand, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harder to latch on and stay focused; unlike DillaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s donuts, these tracks never veer off suddenly or hit unexpected sweet spots. There are a few standalone bangers, particularly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTime WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t TellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe Hit Her So She Left,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a few confounding tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œContagious SnippetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a funk odyssey led by Wilder Zoby, of Def Jux lounge lizards Chin Chin; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEat My Garbage 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a mini-mix of the entire megamixxx with all but the drums removed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but little thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll jolt you to attention. The one communicative sample on the mix, a Twilight Zone clip at the beginning of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow To Serve Man (Stripped)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t chilling, exactly, but it does give the steely menace of the track an explicit context, which is good for at least a few minutes of engagement.\n\nIn the absence of more such framing devices, some of these tracks run together or run aground ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which would be disappointing if the mix had pretentions of breaking new ground, or simply of being an album. But WeareallgoingtoburninhellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s appeal is simply that it showcases El-P less as a producer who makes constantly compelling instrumental songs than as one working tirelessly to describe a mood, one who can take the futuristic sci-fi horror flick in his head and put in your head, too. The mixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most pleasing moments and its most successful donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t usually overlap: some of the beats are fresh, some of the basslines impeccable, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the extramusical sensations, those slithering intimations of robotic insects rooting through the garbage for your financial information, that make this worth engaging with on his terms, not your own.\n\nBy Daniel Levin Becker\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1e3cfbfd1b8bf1bb7d16a5c8eb0c09428a2039","amp;dn":"El-P+-+Weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixxx3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1e3cfbfd1b8bf1bb7d16a5c8eb0c09428a2039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,30,60,251,253,27,139,241,187,125,22,165,200,235,12,9,66,138,32,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

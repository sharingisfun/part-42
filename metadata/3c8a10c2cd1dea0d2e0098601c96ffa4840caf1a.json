At least she'll be able to drown her sorrows with champagne alone in a hot tub instead of alone in her dismal apartment.\n\nIt is a decision that puts her on a collision course with James. A packless alpha, working for the government to track down and eliminate rogue shifters. Other wolves consider James an outcast and a traitor to his own kind, but he has a hidden agenda. A mission to find out who wiped out his entire pack... and why.\n\nWhen these two lost souls find each other neither can explain how they feel so drawn to one another. Carrie, still recovering from her recent rejection, can't believe this untamed and sexy stranger could possibly be interested in her. And James is at a loss to explain how this cute and curvy human can possibly enter his dreams... and why it feels like they were fated to be together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c8a10c2cd1dea0d2e0098601c96ffa4840caf1a","amp;dn":"Molly+Prince+-+Curves+for+the+Lone+Alpha.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c8a10c2cd1dea0d2e0098601c96ffa4840caf1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,138,16,194,205,29,234,13,46,0,152,96,28,150,255,164,132,12,175,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

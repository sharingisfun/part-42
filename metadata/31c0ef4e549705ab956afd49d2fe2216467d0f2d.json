Both duos had been eager to create a new kind of metal sound, beginning with Doom Death Metal and Thrash and soon crafting Psychedelic Metal.\n\nThis Bootleg is a collection of all District Unknown's available songs from their Soundcloud account. All songs on the Bootleg were recorded (or at least uploaded) in 2012. This collection was made in hopes the band's music will be heard.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c0ef4e549705ab956afd49d2fe2216467d0f2d","amp;dn":"District+Unknown+-+Ispandi+Bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c0ef4e549705ab956afd49d2fe2216467d0f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,192,239,78,84,151,5,171,149,106,253,73,210,254,34,22,70,125,15,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

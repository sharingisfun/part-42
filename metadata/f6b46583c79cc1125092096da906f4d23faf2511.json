The duo has only one original song on Carrying On, their second album, and they mostly rely on studio musicians for their energetic neo-honky-tonk and full-tilt retro Southern-rock instrumental backing. Even so, Carrying On (with its telling double-meaning title) is a much more fully realized and compelling work than their bestselling debut.\n\nInformation Disc:\n? Artist:    Montgomery Gentry\n?

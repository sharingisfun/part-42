The couple had fled Vietnam under the cover of darkness, exchanged wedding rings en route to Malaysia, then sold them and their scant possessions to feed themselves and their 10 relatives on the journey. They were declared refugees.\n\nNow, almost 40 years later, their decision to flee Vietnam has been rewarded by a happy and successful life for their family in Australia, the country they are now proud to call home. Here, their daughter Tracy reflects on that life changing journey and the amazing life it created for them in Australia. Today, Tracy is a successful Channel 9 journalist who has chosen to return to her family home to care for her family as they enter old age. Her story shows the extraordinary bravery of her parents and the many refugees like them who now call Australia home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc7a28f9c668d4734225274bd1f5d502b4a2b11","amp;dn":"Small+Bamboo-+How+My+Family%27s+Journey+On+a+Leaky+Boat+Led+to+Our","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc7a28f9c668d4734225274bd1f5d502b4a2b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,199,162,143,156,102,141,71,52,34,82,116,189,31,93,80,43,74,43,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

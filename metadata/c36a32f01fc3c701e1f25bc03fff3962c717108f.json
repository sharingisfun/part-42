What's in this version (v1.3):\n\n+ Improved overall emulation speed!!\n\nNearly all roms should be working.\n\nList of tested and confirmed working ROMs --\n\n* Yoshi's Island DS\n* Professor Layton and the Curious Village \n* Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\n* Monopoly\n* Franklin the Turtle\n* Harvest Moon\n* Pokemon Pearl\n\nREQUIRES A HIGH END ANDROID DEVICE - If the framerate is slow, it's because your phone is not fast enough for this very heavy emulator.\n\nRoms can take a while to load. For example, the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon rom can take one minute to boot up.\n\n\nCurrent features:\n\n* On-screen interface\n* ROM loading\n* Save states\n* APP to SD\n\nHow to play?\nCopy your NDS roms to your SD card and boot up the application. It'll automatically find them. Select your rom and start playing! Make sure the roms are .nds format.\n\nPress the top left button to hide interface elements and use the touch screen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36a32f01fc3c701e1f25bc03fff3962c717108f","amp;dn":"nds4droid+Version+1%2C3+For+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36a32f01fc3c701e1f25bc03fff3962c717108f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,106,50,240,31,195,199,1,225,242,91,192,63,255,57,98,199,23,16,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

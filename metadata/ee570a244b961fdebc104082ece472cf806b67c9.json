To do that she has to wait for a portal to Nightfall to open. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where her mother took him, to her birthplace, to the realm of the fae. The absolute last place Nina wants to go.\nWhen an unexpected portal opens, Nina and her werewolf lover Severin Saint Morgan cross over to the fae realm but they are greeted by armed fae warriors and Severin is arrested for treason. Escorted to Nightfall palace, Nina is greeted coolly by her grandparents whom sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never met and her mother. She is said to be a princess but is treated like a prisoner. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given handmaidens to watch over her and a Chancellor to give her advice, but none of them seem too happy to have her around.\nNow she has to figure out how to find her father, rescue Severin and to keep her head, because there are several of those in Nightfall who would love to see her head on a silver platter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee570a244b961fdebc104082ece472cf806b67c9","amp;dn":"Portal+%28Nina+Decker%29+-+Anna%2C+Vivi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee570a244b961fdebc104082ece472cf806b67c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,87,10,36,75,150,31,222,188,16,64,130,236,228,114,207,128,107,103,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I think I've got it right this time. I was trying to force it into fullscreen when I should have been going widescreen. Hence the new tag on the torrent. (WS) If it looks right (or wrong) leave a comment.\n\n\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE\n--------------\nBACK TO SCHOOL\n\nSAME SONG AND DANCE: For 40 years, policymakers promised to reform education. But as Andrew Ferguson of the Weekly Standard says, it's like an itch that reformers just can't scratch. New reform brings money, and since the reforms don't work, they create need for more money.\n\nROTTEN TO THE CORE?: Common Core is the big education controversy this year. But what does it mean for our kids?\n\nPORN TO PAY TUITION: College has become absurdly expensive. Duke University student &quot;Belle Knox&quot; became a porn star to pay her $60k tuition. Many are repulsed by what she does, but Knox says, &quot;I'm not relying on any government loans or aid, and I think that's something I can definitely be really proud of.&quot;\n\nE-LEARNING: Thanks to new technology, good things are happening in education. Today you can learn a language just by downloading a free app to your phone called Duolingo. Your kids can master their math skills with the app Splash Math. I suggest the new technology may overwhelm the repression of the government education monopoly.\n\nMY TAKE: People who love government control don't understand that central planning usually fails, and that competition is the only thing that serves consumers well. It would work for education too if they'd let it. Then more kids would have an experience like charter school kids. All kids deserve that. We should let our children enjoy the benefits of competition\n\nfoxbusiness[.]com/on-air/stossel/blog/2014/09/02/back-school\n\n\n\nINFO\n----\nAnyway, I ripped this using some cheap Diamond dongle. Ripped using EZ Ripper to their &quot;DVD standard&quot;. Then cut into parts to remove commercials using AVIDemux and then join those files. Using that same tool I then convert using MPEG4 AVC (x264) &amp; AAC (Faac) with a file limitation of 350mb, remove the black bars, and resized to 720x404.\n\nTHANKS GOES OUT TO skJGZV6z FOR KEEPING US SATIATED FOR SO LONG.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Stossel.2014.09.04.Back.to.School.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \nXtra : WM/MediaClassPrimaryID \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7931101e1139354a5749&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef578f57e53838b83dce73c467ec4aa07659795e","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.09.04.Back.to.School.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef578f57e53838b83dce73c467ec4aa07659795e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,87,143,87,229,56,56,184,61,206,115,196,103,236,74,160,118,89,121,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

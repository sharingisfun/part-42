Simple, he is without a doubt the worst recorded of the really great artists still performing. Every time when I listen, I can not help thinking: Why is he not using the same techniques like Brett Dennen or Fink for instance. I want to have him close, so we can intimately share and enjoy his gravity (also one of the best songs ever and not even in the top 2000). But there is always a thick blanket covering his sound.\n\nSo making a playlist is very hard. Especially when the songs are extremely good and I can not Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with the quality requirements of Dutch Treat (clear enough) in mind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ play them publicly. So I just forgot about it.\n\nSo why now. Its time for a small celebration (uploaded &gt; 100,000 Indie Playlists). And I for a real celebration you need something special. And John is. But I assure you it hurts when you have to leave out songs like Belief, Perfectly lonely, Waiting On The World To Change, and Vultures. Just to make space for some real live experience.\n\nPeople say that it does not hurt when you do not know. Maybe you just do not notice it (hurts)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. Enjoy (loudness sometimes compensates a lot),\n\nPS\n\nI like to use this opportunity to thank John Mayer for giving me things you (and I) normally hardly even notice (at all) but we do. Its funny we all experience the same feeling while feeling special. Thanks John, Speak For Me.\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^B043 Speak For Me (John Mayer)\n\n01 John Mayer - Stop This Train\n02 John Mayer - New Deep\n03 John Mayer - My Stupid Mouth\n04 John Mayer - Your Body Is A Wonderland\n05 John Mayer - Fool To Love You\n06 John Mayer - Gravity\n07 John Mayer - If I Ever Get Around To Living\n08 John Mayer - I'm Gonna Find Another You\n09 John Mayer - The Heart Of Life\n10 John Mayer - No Such Thing\n11 John Mayer - Clarity\n12 John Mayer - Daughters\n13 John Mayer - Do You Know Me\n14 John Mayer - Something's Missing\n15 John Mayer - Speak For Me\n16 John Mayer - Assassin\n17 John Mayer - Who Says\n18 John Mayer - Come Back To Bed\n19 John Mayer - Wheel\n20 John Mayer &amp; Taylor Swift - Half Of My Heart\n21 John Mayer - Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\n22 John Mayer - Born And Raised\n23 Alicia Keys &amp; John Mayer - Lesson Learned\n24 John Mayer - Neon (A)\n25 John Mayer - Not Myself (A)\n26 John Mayer - Your Body Is A Wonderland (A)\n27 John Mayer - Why Georgia (A)\n28 John Mayer - Comfortable (A)\n29 John Mayer - Heartbreak Warfare (A)\n30 John Mayer - This Will All Make Perfect Sense Someday (A)\n31 John Mayer - Free Fallin' (A)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f2e15802e21173effd62d89b964e9166aa8b95","amp;dn":"John+Mayer+%28Blues%29+-+Speak+For+Me+%28Dutch+Treat+B043+VBR+MP3+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f2e15802e21173effd62d89b964e9166aa8b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,242,225,88,2,226,17,115,239,253,98,216,155,150,78,145,102,170,139,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After abandoning Wall Street to embrace her lifelong love of cooking, Georgia Pellegrini comes face to face with her first kill. From honoring that first turkey to realizing that the only way we truly know where our meat comes from is if we hunt it ourselves, Pellegrini embarks on a wild ride into the real world of local, organic, and sustainable food.\n \nTeaming up with veteran hunters, she travÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­els over field and stream in search of the main courseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from quail to venison and wild boar, from elk to javelina and squirrel. PellegriniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s road trip careens from the back of an ATV chasing wild hogs along the banks of the Mississippi to a dove hunt with beer and barbeque, to the birthplace of the Delta Blues. Along the way, she meets an array of unexpected charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the Commish, a venerated lifelong hunter, to the lawyer-by day, duck-hunting-Bayou-philosopher at dawnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who offer surprising lessons about food and life. Pellegrini also discovers the dangerous underbelly of hunting when an outing turns illegalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and dangerous.\n \nMore than a food-laden hunting narrative, Girl Hunteralso teaches you how to be a self-sufficient eater. Each chapter offers recipes for finger-licking dishes like:\nwild turkey and oyster stew\nstuffed quail\npheasant tagine\nvenison sausage\nfundamental stocks, brines, sauces, and rubs\nsuggestions for interchanging proteins within each recipe\nEach dish, like each story, is an adventure from beginÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­ning to end.\n \nAn inspiring, illuminating, and often funny jourÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­ney into unexplored territories of haute cuisine, Girl Hunter captures the joy of rolling up your sleeves and getting to the heart of where the food you eat comes from.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efced476ac14c0e3fcec8f2d7d808433f36f7391","amp;dn":"Georgia+Pellegrini+-+Girl+Hunter%3A+Revolutionizing+the+Way+We+Eat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efced476ac14c0e3fcec8f2d7d808433f36f7391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,206,212,118,172,20,192,227,252,236,143,45,125,128,132,51,243,111,115,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

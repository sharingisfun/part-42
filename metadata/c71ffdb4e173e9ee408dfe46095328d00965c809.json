Diagnose Lebensgefahr is an atmospheric black metal band from Sweden. I know, most of you are wondering &quot;Whats Lebensgefahr?&quot; well it means danger in German. So the bands name is Diagnose: Danger. It was created in the mental hospital after Nattramn attacked a 6 year old girl with an ax. If you want the story of Nattramn's hospitalization, read up on it on the Silencer's discography. Im not rewriting or copying it. There is one demo by this band which is currently unobtainable and it is also named Transformalin.\n\n\n\n\nAlbums\n\nTransformalin\n\n\n\nEnjoy And Please Do Seed.\n\nSeeding (Weekdays)- 3:00PM-6:00PM   (Weekends)- 10:00AM-10:00PM   (((Hawaii Time)))\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c71ffdb4e173e9ee408dfe46095328d00965c809","amp;dn":"Diagnose%3A+Lebensgefahr+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c71ffdb4e173e9ee408dfe46095328d00965c809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,31,253,180,225,115,233,238,64,141,254,70,9,83,40,208,9,101,200,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

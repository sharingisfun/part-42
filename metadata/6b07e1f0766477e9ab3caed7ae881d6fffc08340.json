Neither was XP-Key-Reader,WinKeyFinder173_RC2 nor keyfinder-pe\nhowever its all checked, tested and working. \nThank you to ANTIWPA team and others that rebuilt the dlls.\n\nClean No Viruses, No Nagging Mums, No Tojans, No Sims2 lookalikes and no Chocolate bunnies.\n\n\nNOTE (1)       This is a Beta2 Release as I'm the only one that has tested it. \n\t\tFear not it won't break anything.\n\nNOTE (2)   antiWPA.dll will need to be added to exclusions of your Virus Scanner.\n            Virus scanners don't like it. Exclude the folder \n           &quot;C:WINDOWS system32 ANTIWPA&quot; - It's clean. \n\n********************************************************************************************************* \t\n\t \nThe GUI was coded by me. This has been tested on a number of VM's (Virtual Machines) with total success.\n\n \n\nXP ALL CRACK =  X86 Pro and Home Activation working (04-01-2009). I'm lead to believe will work on x64 though not  tested. \n\nREMOVE CRACK = Reverses the above process and restores the backups 'XP ALL CRACK' made\n\nPRO KEYS = Working XPPro keys will work with Activation without a hitch (until M$ blue lists them)\n\n\nKill WPA  =  WPA Windows Product Activation can kiss my arse, this removes it, (backs it up to C:SavedWPA where you can give it verbal abuse and beat it with a stick!) . \n\n\nCheck Status = WGADiag Tool checks your Activation OFFLINE.\n\nCRACKx86  = this is X86 version for all -  working well mostly with Retail Pro and Home. (antiwpa.dll)\n\nUNCRACKx86  = Reverses the changes made with CRACKx86\n\nXP HOME KEY = a few keys that will get your XPHome up and running . Some will &amp; some won't pass M$ 'Bouncers on the Door'(M$ update site) Test for a decent key then Activate.\n\n\n \nThe Good news Unlike many other 'Activate XP' GUI's the dlls haven't been 'built in' which means you can replace them with the latest versions (they're in the folders) and the GUI will still work !\n\n&quot;XP ALL CRACK&quot; is reliant on current checking version as soon as theres new dlls just replace the existing (same names)\n\n***********************************************************************************************************************\n\nExtras:\n\nWinKeyFinder173_RC2 great key changer works in Vista too!\n\nHate the Music? put your own mp3 in the 'Needed'  folder ,making sure it's renamed to Music.mp3!\n\nIn the 'keyfinder-pe' is a program called XP-Key-Reader written by Joshua it finds all the necessary info on a CD and on your Hard Drive regard what type of XP Install you have and you can match a XP Install to your serial number.\n\nCHKPIDS_0.93 - CDKey Finder this is a 'Quality Program' for checking keys against your Install or Installed XP written by CusterBeaten.\n\nMethod of Executing.txt A bit of help and Info if you need it.\n\nFor those still unable to get their updates (highly unlikely) I've included Windows Updates Loader it will get them for you (Install) \n\nIn the Folder 'Needed'  is a file named taskkill.exe it's a file needed and doesn't come with XP Home. Made by M$ and on every XP Pro.\n\n**********************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback please espically if loading XP to a drive other than C: (not looking for praise just need my stuff working correctly)\n\nPlease seed it helps to free the bandwidth :)\n\n\nFightingBigBrother","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b07e1f0766477e9ab3caed7ae881d6fffc08340","amp;dn":"XP+Activator+1.0.2.1.+%28FBB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b07e1f0766477e9ab3caed7ae881d6fffc08340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,7,225,240,118,100,119,233,171,60,174,215,174,136,29,111,255,192,131,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

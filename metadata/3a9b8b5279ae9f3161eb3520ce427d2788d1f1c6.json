As producer John Snyder is quoted in the liner notes, this is bop without cliches. Morgan, who is assisted by pianist Rodney Kendrick, drummer Leroy Williams and either Curtis Lundy or Ray Drummond on bass, digs into such songs as &quot;Well You Needn't,&quot; &quot;A Night In Tunisia&quot; and an 11 Ã‚Â½ minute version of &quot;Half Nelson,&quot; coming up with some surprising twists and plenty of viable ideas. A fine effort.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9b8b5279ae9f3161eb3520ce427d2788d1f1c6","amp;dn":"Frank+Morgan+-+Bop%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9b8b5279ae9f3161eb3520ce427d2788d1f1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,155,139,82,121,174,159,49,97,235,53,32,206,66,125,39,136,209,241,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Their one and only LP &quot;Walpurgis&quot; is legendary and hardly affordable. So, evidently, a lot of bootleg versions appeared on the market over the years, but all of them very poorly done. The CD on Garden of Delights is produced, as usual, with a detailed band story, a lot of illustrations, a detailed discography inclusive label and cover repros, and, last but not least, three bonus tracks. Two of those are taken from the very rare compilation &quot;1. Schweizer Rhythm and Blues Festival&quot;. The early version of &quot;Repent Walpurgis&quot; comes from a so-called split single from 1968, where you can find The Etc on its flip side. Thus, the complete released works of The Shiver can be found on this CD. The fold-out cover artwork designed by HR Giger was taken over unchanged.\n\nEAC Read Mode: Secure with NO C2, accurate stream, disable cache.\n\nFull Artwork\n\n\n\n1. Repent Walpurgis\n2.

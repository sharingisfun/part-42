But with over 150 NoSQL database types, it can be hard for a SQL professional to know where to start. In this course, Lynn Langit breaks these types down into five main categories and shows how to get your own NoSQL database up and running with easy-to-configure cloud solutions. You'll learn how to add and query data and also examine case studies where NoSQL was used to solve real-world data storage management issues.

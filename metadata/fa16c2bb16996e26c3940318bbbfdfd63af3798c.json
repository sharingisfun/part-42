A good percentage of the puzzles are clever and ingenius, and there are a lot of puzzles. These tend to be quite a bit harder than puzzles and problems in other books of this type, though, and don't lend themselves to a casual environment. You may have to sit at a desk with pencil and paper to solve most of these.\n\nContents\nINTRODUCTION vii\n\nARITHMETICAL AND ALGEBRAICAL PROBLEMS I\nMoney Puzzles 3\nAge Puzzles 11\nClock Puzzles 14\nSpeed and Distance Puzzles 16\nWeight Puzzles 30\nDigital Puzzles 32\nSkeleton Puzzles 43\nCryptarithm Puzzles 47\nMiscellaneous Puzzles 50\n\nGEOMETRICAL PROBLEMS 81\nTriangle, Square, and other Polygon Puzzles 83\nCircle Puzzles 96\nDividing-the-Plane Puzzles 101\nPlane Geometry Puzzles 104\nSolid Geometry Puzzles 106\nDissection Puzzles 112\nPaper Folding Puzzles 127\nMoving Counter Puzzles 130\n\nCOMBINATORIAL AND TOPOLOGICAL PROBLEMS 139\nMagic Square Puzzles 141\nMagic Star Puzzles 145\nLiquid Pouring Puzzles 149\nRoute and Network Puzzles 152\nPoint Alignment Puzzles 164\nMap Coloring Puzzles 169\nMiscellaneous Combinatorial Puzzles 170\n\nGAME PUZZLES 183\nDOMINO PUZZLES 189\nMATCH PUZZLES 199\nUNCLASSIFIED PUZZLES 209\nANSWERS 223\nINDEX 417","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa16c2bb16996e26c3940318bbbfdfd63af3798c","amp;dn":"536+Puzzles+%26amp%3B+Curious+Problems+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa16c2bb16996e26c3940318bbbfdfd63af3798c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,22,194,187,22,153,110,38,195,148,3,24,187,191,223,214,58,243,121,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

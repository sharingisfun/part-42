Her departure from the band, The Banner Project, led her into a marriage that was doomed to fail and deeply damaged her relationship with Mitchell, whom she has avoided for the past ten years.

Shortly after Desiree arrives in her hometown of Pinewood Hills, she learns that the town will face bankruptcy if it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a bond repayment by the July 4th Holiday.

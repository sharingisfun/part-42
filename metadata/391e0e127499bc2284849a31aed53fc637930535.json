Casey's final AT40 of the first Casey era show aired on August 6, 1988. At no point during that final show did Kasem ever let on that any changes were afoot, and simply omitted the phrase &quot;join me next week&quot; while closing the show.\n\nIn 1997, Casey Kasem acquired the rights to the American Top 40 name. On March 28, 1998 the second Casey era of American Top 40 began. \n\nKasem's last show as host of AT40 aired on the weekend of January 3/4, 2004. His final #1 was Outkast's &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;.\n\nCasey plays a medley of different artists' &quot;The First Cut Is The Deepest&quot; starting with the 1969 original by Cat Stevens, then Keith Hamphsire, Rod Stewart, and this week's version at number 31 by Sheryl Crow.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells how Flagstaff, Arizona got its name before he introduces Flagstaff native Michelle Branch, at number 19 with her song, &quot;Breathe.&quot;\n\nSo far in the rock era, there have been twelve number one songs with the word &quot;baby&quot; in the title. Casey lists some of them, and then plays the song that grows that list to 13, &quot;Baby Boy&quot; by Beyonce (and featuring Sean Paul, at number 7).\n\n&quot;Suga Suga&quot; by Baby Bash is at number 3. Casey remembers a different &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; by Wilson Picket that was on the chart for Casey's very first AT40 show.\n\n40:    Wat Da Hook Gon Be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Murphy Lee featuring Jermaine Dupri\n39:    Who Will I Run To?

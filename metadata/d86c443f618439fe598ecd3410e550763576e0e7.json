The sex-starved Schmidlap sits around drawing lewd pictures of naked women.\n\nMr. Quonset (Robert Morley), the head of NAWA, is concerned that the situation with Hoffman and Schmidlap threatens to become an embarrassment to NAWA. Furthermore, the Soviets have taken a step forward in the space race by placing the first (unmarried) male/female couple on the moon. Quonset decides the US should place the first married couple in space.\n\nWith the next NAWA space launch looming, the married astronauts scheduled for the mission split up. Quonset quickly turns to Peter Mattemore (Jerry Lewis) and Eileen Forbes (Connie Stevens), unmarried astronauts who have been at NAWA for years without having flown a mission. Forbes agrees to the marriage on the condition that they be married in name only, and the union is made official as they are rushed up the gantry for their space launch.\n\nWhen they arrive on the moon, they receive regular visits from the Russian astronauts, Anna Soblova (Anita Ekberg) and Igor Baklenikov (Dick Shawn), living at the nearby Soviet lunar station. Antics ensue with vodka pill parties and the men preening for their beautiful female companions. The Soviets are suspected of trying to sabotage the U.S. space station, but they are soon vindicated.\n\nAnna tricks Igor into marrying her by declaring she is pregnant. Once they are married she tells him the truth, and the Americans, who are now in love themselves, declare their intentions to have a &quot;moon baby&quot;. As the film ends, the space race has escalated into a race to see which country will be the first to have a baby born on the moon.\n\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 699 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 40mn\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 973 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                          : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Custom\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 40mn\nBit rate                                 : 836 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 608 pixels\nHeight                                   : 256 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.179\nStream size                              : 601 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 0.0.09 (UTC 2003-03-25)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 1h 40mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 122 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 88.0 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 489 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86c443f618439fe598ecd3410e550763576e0e7","amp;dn":"Way+Way+Out+-+Jerry+Lewis+-+1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86c443f618439fe598ecd3410e550763576e0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,108,68,63,97,132,57,254,89,142,205,52,16,229,80,118,53,118,224,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

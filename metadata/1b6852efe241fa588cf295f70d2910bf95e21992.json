Before being signed they received extensive airplay in Iowa markets alongside other CCM Artists. Unknown to them, they were entered into a talent search contest for Christian music giant Word Records. They rejected a contract offer in order to reach a more mainstream market, instead signing with Squint Entertainment.\n\nTheir name is a play on the 38th parallel north, which divides North Korea from South Korea. Their first album, Turn the Tides, was released in 2002, following the band's nationwide tour with artists Skillet and The Benjamin Gate. The album received a Dove Award nomination in 2003 for Rock Album of the Year.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of 38th Parallel, vocalist Mark Jennings, guitarist Jason Munday, and drummer Aaron Nordyke formed the Harry Potter-themed electronica band Ministry of Magic.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b6852efe241fa588cf295f70d2910bf95e21992","amp;dn":"38th+Parallel+Discography+1998-2005+%284+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b6852efe241fa588cf295f70d2910bf95e21992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,104,82,239,226,65,250,88,140,242,149,247,13,41,16,191,149,226,25,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

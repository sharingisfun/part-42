Budget is $35m, most expensive movie in Asia.\n\n2. 2250 prints, 3000 screens, largest worldwide screening after 'Spiderman'.\n\n3.In three language versions, Tamil,Telugu &amp; Hindi with Eng Subs\n\n4. The special effects are as good as Hollywood movies like Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla which is composed of 1500 graphical shots.\n\n\n\nStory:\nThis is a story of android based humanoid named Chitti.\nThe Movie itself has 2 parts. The first part is getting to know the robot and its purpose (can be compared to the movie &quot;the bicentennical man with robin williams)\nIt has a lot of funny scenes in action/comedy style.\nThe second half is action based with a hell lot of cgi like in the movies IROBOT,MATRIX,TERMINATOR etc.\nThe Movie is mostly hindi with eng subs and has a very good soundtrack.\n\nHive:\nI watched the movie before spreading it.\nIt is really amazing, this movie has everything in one film combined. You get action,comedy,stunts,fighting scenes, love story and a very good audio soundtrack.\nThe movie had my attention from the beginning troughout and was getting better and better till the last minute.\nI have never seen such a good movie that is not from usa, and the hindi-english audio didnt bother me at all. the story is clear and understandable. and i laughed a really a lot, more then in usa comedy-movies nowadays.\nthis movie should be seen by everyone who likes action, you wont get disappointed.\n\nEncode:\nit wasnt easy to get the full sourcedvd which is needed for the bitrate for the fast action scenes.\nThe Subs on the dvd itself are not hardcoded and were partly within the black border area.\nBy cropping away the borders the subs would have been also cut away. Had to extract and replace the subs new and hardcoded them within the video.\nAlso the movie is nearly 3 hours long and need a lot of bitrate for the action scenes.\nAlso had to remove the interlace, added brightness,sharpness,corrected rgb colours and denoise.\nOverall very nice\n\nps: there are 3 music intermezzos in the movie which belong to the movie  5 mins.\n\nVideo: 720x320 @bitrate 1800 2pass\nAudio: DTS to AC3 5.1 @384\nSample: yes included\nSubs: yes eng subs are hardcoded[/b]\n\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305797/[/url]\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Endhiran.2010.DVDRip.READNFO.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 2.50 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 43mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 187 Kbps\nWriting application              : AVI-Mux GUI 1.17.7, Aug  8 2006  20:59:17\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 43mn\nBit rate                         : 1 798 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 320 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.25:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.325\nStream size                      : 2.05 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 2h 43mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 449 MiB (18%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 64 ms (1.53 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 192 ms\n\n\n\n\nRajinikanth as Dr. Vaseegaran and Chitti Babu\nAishwarya Rai as Sana\nDanny Denzongpa as Dr. Bohra\nKarunas as Ravi\nSanthanam as Siva\nDevadarshini as Latha\nSabu Cyril as Agent Shah\n\n\n\nDr. Vasi (Rajnikanth) invents a super-powered robot, Chitti, in his own image. The scientific body, AIRD, that must approve the robot, declines it based on its not having emotions and the ability to make rational judgment. A sudden flash of lightning evokes emotions in the robot, and Chitti is seemingly ready for integration into the human world. Then, Chitti falls in love with Dr. Vasi's fiance Sana (Aishwarya Rai) and turns on his creator. \n\n\n\n\n[img]http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/6514/88865069.png[/img]\n[img]http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/7113/enen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/9344/enenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8795/enenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4125/enenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/7107/enenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7310/enenenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/1332/enenenenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/4893/enenenenenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/9134/enenenenenenenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/5466/enenenenenenenenenen.png[/img]\n[img]http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/3115/eneneennenenenenenenene.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetz\n\niNK,LUSi,,MAGNET,CLASSiFiED,THC,LEGi0N,IMAGiNE,ViSiON,WBZ,FLAWL3SS,NOVA\nRapeseed,D2U,SAFC,goldadvance,MEMORY100,KaN1vE,Unevano,Pinnz,Wayne,Mr Hive\nand all P2P groups \nGreat Work Guys :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35433e0d3b6aeba87f3e4ba3f39720904551d3c3","amp;dn":"Endhiran.2010.DVDRip.READNFO.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35433e0d3b6aeba87f3e4ba3f39720904551d3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,67,62,13,59,106,235,168,127,62,75,163,243,151,32,144,69,81,211,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

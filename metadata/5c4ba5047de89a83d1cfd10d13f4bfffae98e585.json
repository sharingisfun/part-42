Just as artistic skill is honed over years of hard work and many a masterpiece was created late in an artistÃƒÂ¢??s life, these Late-Style leaders are rejuvenating leadership instead of handing off their power.\n\nAbout the author:\nI have studied leadership development for the last twenty five years. In the 1980s, I published the first business bestseller in 30 years, a book describing a brand new business method: Theory Z, the clarion call on the power of Japanese management and how Toyota and others were about to eat DetroitÃƒÂ¢??s lunch. In the 90s, I started the first business book division, Currency, devoted to the changes a new cadre of workersÃƒÂ¢??Baby BoomersÃƒÂ¢??were making in organizations. After leaving Currency, I wrote books as well as for Fast Company and Inc., and more recently The Wall Street Journal. This May, Warner published The Mona Lisa Stratagem: The Art of Women, Age and Power, which is the basis of the ideas in this manifesto.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4ba5047de89a83d1cfd10d13f4bfffae98e585","amp;dn":"The+%5C%27New+Age%5C%27+of+Leadership+%28PDF%29%28Manifesto%29+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4ba5047de89a83d1cfd10d13f4bfffae98e585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,75,165,4,125,232,154,131,209,207,209,13,19,244,191,255,174,152,229,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This series tackles four of these exploits, glimpsed through centuries-old literature and art, which were miraculously advanced for their time. Now, historians, technicians and artisans have come together to try to equal their forebears' genius and expertise and understand how these major achievements came about.\n\nPart 3. Submarine\nIn September 1776 a unique event marked the start of a whole new field of warfare: the world's first submarine attack. Designed to place a mine on the hull of a British warship in New York harbour, the submarine would be unrecognisable today. Made of wood, it was shaped like two turtle shells stuck together. So unlikely was its design that many doubt it ever existed. In order to test whether it could have ever achieved its mission, a group of amateur submarine enthusiasts attempt to rebuild the turtle using only the materials and tools available to its original designer.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 49 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 680 MB\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d983048476f72f631960d22496b230db340d8a30","amp;dn":"Ch4+Machines+Time+Forgot+3of4+Submarine+576p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d983048476f72f631960d22496b230db340d8a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,131,4,132,118,247,47,99,25,96,210,36,150,178,48,219,52,13,138,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

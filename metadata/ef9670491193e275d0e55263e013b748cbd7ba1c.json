When Mendusa entered the orbit of planet\n Earth, and word got around that\n it was a planet ruled almost entirely by men,\n two of the most rebellious Mendusan\n menservants managed to escape.\n\nThe first four episodes dealt with the arrival \non Earth of the two rebels, Adam and\n Shem (Gareth Thomas of Blakes 7), and their \nconstant endeavours to remain. In \nsubsequent episodes the action alternated between\n the two planets, resulting in \neach episode having a self-contained storyline \nwithin the series.\n\nAfter narrowly avoiding being killed when they\n crash-landed on Earth, the two \nrenegade males appealed to the authorities to \nallow them asylum from the pursuing\n women - but on board the Mendusan ship Nemesis,\n Chief Security Controller Octavia\n and Adam's mistress (and lover) Grand Councilor\n Fulvia were already heading for Earth. \n\nFulvia wanted the return of her runaway servant\n (who she treated more like a pet) and \nit wasn't long before aggressive super-bitch\n Octavia was ordering several Earth police\n officers about, expecting them to react like \nthe men on her home planet. \n\nMeanwhile, after trying to communicate with a\n herd of cows, (and following their lead\n by eating grass!)  Adam and Shem found their\n way to a large castle where they sought\n refuge. Unable to resist their curiosity, \nEarthling Doctor Rudi Schmidt and Liz Becker\n from the Astronomical Institute explored \ninside the unattended Nemesis. Rudi \naccidentally triggered a device which blinded\n him, and the panic-stricken Liz turned to\n the craft's occupants for help upon their \nreturn. (They activated a medical droid who \nperformed a brief operation and a much relieved\n Rudi made a perfect recovery). \n\nOctavia then piloted the ship to the castle \nwhere she had tracked Adam and Shem, and\n activated something called the Nightmare Cannon\n - a weapon that feeds upon a person's \nfear - forcing both men outside to plead for mercy. \nUnfortunately, before Nemesis could\n land it was struck by lightning and damaged, \nand had to return to space for repairs.\n\nOctavia kidnapped the two scientists in the hope\n of arranging an exchange for Adam and\n Shem (much to the annoyance of Professor Evans on\n Earth, who was enjoying picking the\n alien's brains in his quest for more knowledge). \n\nMeanwhile Fulvia was drugged with champagne and\n kidnapped by a foreign power who wanted \nthe secrets of Mendusa's advanced technology, \nwhile up on Mendusa Dr Rudi Schmidt crossed\n swords with Octavia and was tried by a jury of\n computers and sent onto the barren surface\n of the planet  to join a work detail.\n\nWhile here, Schmidt organised a breakout and \ndestroyed the hovering patrol vehicle by \nreflecting its own ray back against it with a\n mirror. The escape bid was foiled by President \nClara, whose pleas worked on the dumb male escapees\n as their conditioning caused them to \nobey the women's orders and open the hatch to admit\n the red-helmeted female security guards with paraguns\n - a ray gun that causes temporary paralysis).\n\nOctavia meanwhile ordered Liz Becker to be attached to \na bizarre machine called the sexometer,\n which worked on the mind - On a large video screen we \nsaw a muscle-bound, macho, blond guy,\n but Liz rebelled and the image changed into a hideous \nsnake.  Octavia boosted the power and\n restored the hunk until Liz changed it again by sheer \nwillpower. Over and over again it \nchanged back and forth from man to beast until the\n machine blew a circuit  \n- Shades of Barbarella . . .\n\nDown on Earth, Adam has rescued Fulvia and the pair\n have decided to try and live together \nas man and wife (but in reverse, with her working and\n him staying at home to \ndo the housework), but Adam tired of Fulvia's jealousy\n and called it a day. Packing his bags\n and leaving her, he rescued the weak-willed Shem who\n had been dominated by two women's libbers\n and forced to show them how to use a paragun \n(most of this sequence was shot on a Barrat \nhousing estate - a sign that the budget was running out).\n\nBack on Planet Chick, Rudi worked out that the rain was \ndisintegrating Mendusa's crust and it \nwas only a matter of time before all the Mendusans were\n killed, but Octavia refused to listen\n to the good doctor - as their 'Prediction Computer' \ninsisted there was nothing wrong.\n Rudi ultimately had a new air purification system shut\n down and saved the day. \n\nIn the end,  Rudi and Liz were returned to Earth in \nexchange for Adam and Shem \n(on the way home, Adam shot down an age-old enemy of the\n Mendusans and saved Octavia's life.\n Reluctantly she voiced her gratitude to the MAN\n who saved her . . . Ironic, huh?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9670491193e275d0e55263e013b748cbd7ba1c","amp;dn":"Star+Maidens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9670491193e275d0e55263e013b748cbd7ba1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,150,112,73,17,147,226,117,208,229,82,99,224,19,183,72,203,215,186,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

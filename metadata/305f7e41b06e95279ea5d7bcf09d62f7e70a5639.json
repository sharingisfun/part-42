These two--these two just might do.&quot; \nArtie Wu is a fat 37-year-old Chinaman--and also the pretender to the Emperor's throne. Durant is, well, different. The scene is Southern California. There's the beach at Malibu with its latest resident--a dead pelican. Then there are the sleazier sides of Venice and the city of Pelican Bay. And of course, there are the small matters of a missing woman and a dead Congressman. Throw in a multimillionaire, a Mafia boss and his old college roommate (late of the CIA), and you've got yourself a gripping yarn. \n\n  &quot;Thomas's prose matches the fast pace of his action: it clicks with the urgent rat-a-tat of a news teleprinter: He is the master of the quickly stroked profile, the irony of juxtaposed fact. He does tell a good story in crackling fashion, with an observant eye for detail.&quot; --The Washington Post \n\n\n&quot;An excellent book!&quot; --FerraBit!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305f7e41b06e95279ea5d7bcf09d62f7e70a5639","amp;dn":"CHINAMAN%5C%27S+CHANCE+-+Ross+Thomas.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305f7e41b06e95279ea5d7bcf09d62f7e70a5639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,95,126,65,176,110,149,39,158,165,215,188,240,157,98,247,231,10,86,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

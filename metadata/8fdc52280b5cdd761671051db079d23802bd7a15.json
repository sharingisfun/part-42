RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: EA/Crap\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports\n\nWinner of 20 &quot;Best Sports Game of E3&quot; awards, including the prestigious E3\nGame Critics award, FIFA 12 brings to the pitch the game-changing new Player\nImpact Engine, a physics engine built to deliver real-world physicality in\nevery interaction on the pitch. Experience the way real-world footballers\nchallenge each other for the ball, win possession, and test each other\nphysically. Enjoy an infinite variety of natural and believable outcomes in\nevery collision. Players feel more resilient, push and pull during the fight\nfor possession, and recover from light challenges more easily\n\nRevolutionary gameplay innovations make FIFA 12 deeper and more engaging\nAll-new Precision Dribbling creates a higher fidelity of touch on the ball\nfor better control in tight spaces, more time to make decisions on attack,\nand more control over the pace of the game. Innovations in attack are\nbalanced by a re-designed defending mechanism, making it as skilful and\nmeaningful as real-world football. With all-new Tactical Defending,\npositioning and intercepting passes are as important as tackling. Tactics\nand timing are crucial. Plus, CPU players have been infused with Pro Player\nIntelligence, a self-awareness that enables them to behave and make\ndecisions based on their own skills and tendencies, and gives them the\naptitude to understand the strengths and weaknesses of teammates in every\nsituation\n\n2.

The main difference between this, and similar programs for the PSP is\nthe implementation of sound and speech. This allows you to hear indications through your car stereo,\nor through earphones while out on the street so you can leave the PSP in your pocket.\n\n\n       ********************************* Grant Of Software License **********************************\n\n\nThe Road Dog program is free to use, but I retain ownership of my software, and grant of license to use\nit is under identical terms of GPS Trackmaker license agreement (reproduced in part with permission),\nthat pertain to conservation of protected ecosystems. View the entire agreement for GPS Trackmaker:\nhttp://www.gpstm.com/downloadscontract.php\n\n&quot;LICENSE GRANT\n\nThe author grants a non-exclusive license to use the program, free of charge, if the user:\nDoes not use the program for illegal purposes;\ndoes not practice activities that destroy or degrades the environment;\ndoes not practice polluting activities;\ndoes not throw trash on the ground or through the carÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s windows;\nwhen going to the beach and creeks takes his trash back until finding a trash collector;\ndoes not practice any activities that hurts animals, like hunting, out-of-season fishing, pigeon shooting,\ndog fight, etc.;\ndoes not buy wild animals that, by law, may not be created out of their natural environment;\nhas ecological conscience and protects nature.\nPeople that for any reason do not fit the conditions above, are expressly forbidden to use the program.&quot;\n\nIn addition to the above agreement, grant of Lisence to use the Road Dog program, also requires\nadhesion to the following terms:\n\nWhen the user visits a Beach or other body of water, National Park or other protected environment,\nhe or she leaves no damage to live vegetation, leaves no unnatural polluting material, or litter,\nand removes non-combustible material from fireplaces, or litter that may have been left by other people\nif it is reasonable to do so.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nRoad Dog is not designed to allow theft of bandwidth or internet services, or to facillitate hacking of\nprivate networks. Usage in this way is probably illegal, and the user engages in such activity at their\nown risk. I disclaim responsibility for any such use. Lecture over!\n\n\n       ***********************************************************************************************\n\n\nTo Install the Road Dog program, copy the program folders to the PSP/GAME or PSP GAME150 folder of your PSP.\nNow you should be able to launch the program from the Game menu. Road Dog is tested with a 3.03 SE and 5.00m33-6 with 1.50 kernel firmware.\nPSP unit, but may work with other 1.50 kernel firmwares as well. It will not work with the PSP slim &amp; lite.\n\n\n       ************************* Road Dog Network Profile Auto Update Feature ************************\n\n\nThe profile auto update feature updates a PSP network profile for later use in the PSP Browser or other\nPSP networking program that uses one of the preset networking profiles.\n\nThe profile must be prepared manualy. To do this, Navigate in your XMB menu to:\nSettings, Network Settings, Infrastructure Mode, click on Infrastructure Mode,\nand create a new connection profile by pressing [New Connection].\nNow select Enter Manually, then enter any SSID (or none at all),\nSelect None for the WLAN Security Setting, Easy Address Settings.\nThe Name for this profile must be &quot;Road Dog&quot; (no inverted commas and case sensitive).\nSave this connection profile, and it's ready to be auto updated by Road Dog.\n\nIf your PSP has had more connection profiles that have been deleted,\nyour registry may skip the connection profile ID numbers of the deleted connections.\nThis will currently crash Road Dog.\nRestoring your PSP registry with (Restore Default Settings) in your XMB menu will fix this issue.\nContinue to set up the Road Dog connection profile first,\nand it will not be a problem if you delete any connections that were created after it.\n\nNow your connection is set up, start the program and see network details on the screen as always.\nNow when you press the CROSS button, the next unsecured network that is detected with at least\n30% signal quality will be written to the Road Dog PSP network connection profile..\n\nRoad Dog will auto exit when this happens so you can go straight into the PSP Internet Browser,\nand try the connection. You can also check the new SSID was written in your Network Settings.\n\n\n       ***********************************************************************************************\n\n\nRoad Dog was partly written in a tent in the bush! Particularly routines that search and check network profiles\nwith Skylark's PSP registry tools. The program has also been partly written using a laptop, and solar power!\nA long way from being the program to be written entirely on solar power, but hey, I broke a solar controller\non the main trip to write a planned feature of this program, it was hot, and I didn't get much done,\nThe road photo in the intro background was shot on the way there!\n\nCheck out the Road Dog Page on my website:\n\nSee an early Road Dog version tested on YouTube here:\n\nSee one of the first graphing versions tested here:\n\nSee the early Network Profile Auto Updater here:\n\nNow cough up those 32 Mb Memory Sticks! Contact me if you have any low capacity Memory Sticks to donate :)\n\n\n       ***********************************************************************************************\n\n\n*Donations*\nLicense to use this program will remain free, but I am accepting donations toward new hardware and development.\nYou can encourage future program and/or hardware development by sending a donation.\n\nI have particular need for low capacity Memory Sticks, even a 32 Mb one can be used for programming.\n\nContact me on the PSPU, Austech, or X-Flash forums.\nCheers, Art.\nhttp://www.austech.info/forums/\n(www.austech.info)\n\n\n       **********************************************************************************************\n\n\nVERSION HISTORY:\n\nV2d (03/01/08):\n- Improved startup, and WiFi scanning speed. This should be just noticeable.\n- Added feature to save screenshot when the NOTE button is pressed.\n- Reduced size of program by removing unused samples from the player routine.\n\nV2c (29/12/07):\n- Added configuration file parser by A_Noob. Now some options are user configurable.\n- Fixed Space Invader Hit Sound problem. Works properly now.\n\nV2b (28/12/07):\n- Removed network profile error checking as a quick fix for 3.71 M33 firmware users.\n- Added Space Invader hit sound for saving network profile, when the smiley face appears.\n\nV2 (22/12/07):\n- Large size graph is set by default since six connections still fit on the screen.\n- Made a correction so that all the PSP's LEDs function normaly once the program is exit.\n- Added implementation of registry tools ported by Skylark to update a PSP network profile ready for browser.\n- Added a small animated graphic indicator for when there has been no activity for a few minutes.\n\nV1e (16/12/07):\n- Rrogram exit will now reset the PSP if it was launched from within iRShell (rather than freezing).\n- All LEDs are now turned off by the program.\n- Implementation of signal graph that logs to the screen. You see the last 3 mins, 50 secs of activity.\n- Basic familiar name search feature.\n\nV1d (14/12/07):\n- Fixed program exit so the HOME button is responsive. Program now also exits properly within iRshell.\n- Signal strength is only spoken when it changes.  It won't keep repeating the same value.\n- Added check for WLAN switch. error message is displayed, and program exit if WLAN is off, or fails.\n- Auto screen brightness control implementation.\n- PSP is clocked at 133/133/1, unless run from iRshell, in which case the clock speed isn't changed.\n\nV1c (14/12/07):\n- Added basic sound implementation for indication of unsecured wifi hotspots.\n- Limited the size of network names that can be printed to the screen, so they don't overrun to other fields.\n\nV1b (13/12/07):\n- Demonstration Preliminary version using GU texture font shows connection info, and has multicoloured display.\n- Program can be exited with HOME button.\n\nV1 (12/12/07):\n- Preliminary version using Intrafont library gave me graphics issues, so I chose to use another GU texture font.\n\n\n       **********************************************************************************************\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a372f75989aa14f3c6626f582df0eb394dc68b","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Road+Dog+V2d+%28wifi+sniffer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89a372f75989aa14f3c6626f582df0eb394dc68b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,163,114,247,89,137,170,20,243,198,98,111,88,45,240,235,57,77,198,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

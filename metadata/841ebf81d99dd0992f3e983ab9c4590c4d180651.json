Saving Grace 06:22\n\nCry of Love&amp;#039;s debut was a near-perfect fusion of classic British hard-rock influences (read Free) and Southern rock sensibility, bringing a refreshing honesty to the dreary radio landscape of the early &amp;#039;90s. Vocalist Kelly Holland&amp;#039;s gritty delivery (at times reminiscent of Billy Squier) is a perfect foil for the Hendrix flourishes of guitarist Audley Freed, resulting in stellar moments like &quot;Highway Jones,&quot; &quot;Pretty as You Please,&quot; and the grinding &quot;Hand Me Down.&quot; Vying for the crown as the band&amp;#039;s best song are the two radio staples: &quot;Bad Thing&quot; with its thumping bassline and effusive hand claps, and &quot;Peace Pipe,&quot; a genuine counter-culture anthem for the &amp;#039;90s. ~ Ed Rivadavia, All Music Guide \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841ebf81d99dd0992f3e983ab9c4590c4d180651","amp;dn":"Cry+of+Love+-+Brother+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841ebf81d99dd0992f3e983ab9c4590c4d180651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,30,191,129,217,157,208,153,47,62,152,58,185,196,89,12,77,24,6,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

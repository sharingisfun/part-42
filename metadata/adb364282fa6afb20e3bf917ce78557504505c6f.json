The one sampler that sticks out\nfrom the crowdÃƒÂ  at the price of a CD-single!\n\nOne of the most popular compilation series of the scene returns\nwith a sixth instalmentÃƒÂ  and yet again, the brand name\nÃƒÂ´ElectrostormÃƒÂ¶ stands synonymous for unconditional quality. The\nnew sampler yet again unites the most important bands and highly\npromising newcomers from the international Electro-scene on a\njam-packed disc at the sensationally low price point of a CD-\nsingle! The song selection features several songs that are\npreviously unreleased and some rare remixes while the line up of\nfeatured bands should make any Electrohead's mouth water. From\ntop dogs like Blutengel (with a rarity), Combichrist, Hocico,\nSuicide Commando (with a completely new song), Melotron, Solitary\nExperiments, Acessory (with a previously unreleased remix) or\nAshbury Heights (who dish up an as yet unreleased appetizer for\ntheir upcoming album), right down to promising newcomers like The\nSexorcist, Tanzresonanz (side projects of Agonoize), Too Dead To\nDie, Sleepless In Pyongyang (ex-DIN (A) Tod), Massive Ego and\nDear Strange, it reads like a who is who of everything that a fan\nof synthetic sounds, fat beats and machine-induced pressurization\ncould wish for. Over one hour of pure, electronic bliss that\ncovers the entire bandwidth of our highly versatile scene at a\nprice that is less than two beers at your local watering hole!\nThe perfect companion for abroad, at home, at the fitness studio,\nat parties and at clubs! Join the movement! Join the\nElectrostorm!\n\n[GROUPNOTES]\n\nFWYH : FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD, We're all about Family\nDedication, Quality, Respect &amp; LOVE for the music!\nAs the years pass, all our motives and objectives\nremain,we want to give the best of dark electronic\ngenres,with the quality deserved for the only true\nunderground scene, the Future is these genres!!!!!\n\nTo all the artists that we release, some newcomers\n&amp; other established acts: We are sorry if you dont\nunderstand the promotion we do, of your own work,\nbut if you make quality music, we are pretty sure\nthat a lot of people will spend their own money on\nyour art.

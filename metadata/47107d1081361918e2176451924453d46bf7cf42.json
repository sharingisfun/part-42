Gathered since 2010, the band owes its name to the ancient Germanic definition of the river Brenta, which runs aside the highland and breaks through Bassano.\r\nThe root brun- refers to the meaning â€œspring, source, fontâ€, as the origin of all comes from water, specifically in this case, a river; and this bandÃ¢Â€â„¢s inspiration too.\r\nOn these highlands people used to speak a very old Germanic dialect, known as Tzimbar, a language which brings in its words powerful and untold meanings, which are constantly researched by the band.\r\nFrom their isolated ancestors and their culture, the members draw the other side of their inspiration. They were just woodsmen, shepherds, hutÃ¢Â€â„¢s owner, born where Norse mythology meld with Venetic tradition in a mixture that is still alive now, even if rare and probably doomed to disappear.\r\nAsiago is a melting pot, as a cauldron where different elements were put together to get a real balance formulation.\r\nSongs are sung both in Tzimbar and Italian, texts are about heritage and nature, folklore, alchemy and philosophy hidden behind legends or simple stories. The great expressed through simplicity.\r\nThis new disc as well as the first demo is a journey, each song is a step to arrive at the ending where a new awareness can be found: in fact, it is a kind of realistic myth or dreamlike path in five chapters and an interlude.\r\nRaw and folk sounds, screams and choirs, they all come in one to spread deep contrasting feelings, in order to share the bandÃ¢Â€â„¢s thoughts and emotions with the listener.\r\nIt is an experience of old school black metal which would open itself to new horizons, by means of alpine heritage and unusual lyrics.\r\n\r\nYear: 2016\r\nCountry: Italy\r\nGenre: Pagan Black Metal\r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: 320Kbps\r\nSize: 108 MB\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n1.

It finds and fixes broken registry links and damaged files, frees up disk space, reclaims system memory, accelerates startup time, and boosts application and system performance. It opens applications faster, and lets you run more of them simultaneously.\nNorton Utilities can help make your PC will run like new again. Unlike other PC tune-up software, Norton Utilities focuses 100 percent on performance and provides easy-to-use tools that make a real difference. Make your computer boot faster by prioritizing the startup programs with Startup Manager. Instead of letting Microsoft Windows load programs you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need, Startup Manager loads only the programs you choose. Management tools let you view and manage the memory usage of running applications so you can make adjustments that improve PC performance. You can also evaluate the performance of your PC by benchmarking it against other PCs.\n\nKey Technologies:\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Disk Cleaner\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Disk Bleacher\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Startup Manager\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Registry Defragmenter\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Registry Cleaner\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Service Manager\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Disk Cleaner\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Disk Bleacher\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Startup Manager\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Registry Defragmenter\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Registry Cleaner\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Service Manager\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ System Optimizer\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Performance TestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢\n\n Key Benefits:\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Finds and fixes PC problems with one clickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Automatically detects and fixes Microsoft Windows issues so you can spend more time using your PC and less time troubleshooting.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Speeds up PC boot time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Accelerates PC boot time and reduces unnecessary waiting by prioritizing startup applications.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reclaims PC memoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Optimizes the registry for quicker application launch and a faster running PC.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Finds and fixes PC problems with one clickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Automatically detects and fixes Microsoft Windows issues so you can spend more time using your PC and less time troubleshooting.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Speeds up PC boot time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Accelerates PC boot time and reduces unnecessary waiting by prioritizing startup applications.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reclaims PC memoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Optimizes the registry for quicker application launch and a faster running PC.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Frees up hard disk spaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Boosts overall PC performance by defragging your hard drive, freeing up storage space, and recouping system resources.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Protects your personal informationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Permanently deletes unwanted sensitive files from your PC so hackers canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t access your data.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Helps prevent system errorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Undoes erroneous registry tasks and commands to help keep your PC running error-free.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Benchmarks your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Determines whether your PC is performing at its best by benchmarking it against similar systems.\n\n Features:\nSolves PC Problems\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatically detects and fixes Microsoft?

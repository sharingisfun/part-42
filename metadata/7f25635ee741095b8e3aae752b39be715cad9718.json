When originally shown, they generated the biggest ever postbag of Whicker's career, but after thirty years will they still be together - and what will all the surgery have done to them? Also in this episode, Whicker explores once more the closed community of the ultra-wealthy ladies of Palm Beach. He revisits the groundbreaking 1960s programme where he filmed the trial of modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, who were both facing the death penalty, and looks back at startling footage of America's first so-called serial killer seconds after his arrest. Whicker also re-examines his extraordinary interview with Haitian dictator Papa Doc, his most critically acclaimed film for which he won the prestigious Dumont Award.\n\nTechnical Specs for Std-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CAVLC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kb/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFrame Rate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 840MB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVD\n\nforums dot mvgroup dot org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f25635ee741095b8e3aae752b39be715cad9718","amp;dn":"BBC+Alan+Whickers+Journey+of+a+Lifetime+3of4+DVDRip+x264+576p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f25635ee741095b8e3aae752b39be715cad9718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,37,99,94,231,65,9,91,142,58,174,117,43,57,190,113,92,173,151,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

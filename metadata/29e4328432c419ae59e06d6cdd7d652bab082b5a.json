Inspired by Neil YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s producer David BriggsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work, Madeline followed the strategy of On The Beach and TonightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recording whenever and wherever they could find a couple of microphones, and focusing on capturing the energy of a live show. Black Velvet sounds like an Arthur Russel record one minute, all bedroom pop and private crooning, while turning around and twisting into dark Jefferson Airplane-esque psychedelia the next. MadelineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature Karen Carpenter/Neko Case meets The Carter Family southern ballads still make an appearance with lyrics about everything from Johnny CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career as heavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s angel barber to the joy of talking cops out of DUIs. Black Velvet is one of those albums you can see while you hear; a mental music video for every song. Madeline has finally and fearlessly let her mind, mouth and heart open far enough for everyone to get a good look and the results are nothing short of thrilling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e4328432c419ae59e06d6cdd7d652bab082b5a","amp;dn":"Madeline+-+Black+Velvet+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e4328432c419ae59e06d6cdd7d652bab082b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,228,50,132,50,196,25,174,89,224,109,108,221,125,101,43,171,8,43,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

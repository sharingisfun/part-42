Dr Sharma comes  \n                    up with a plan to diagnose the miners' health  \n                    problems, and a rather unusual van arrives in  \n                    the village. The driver, a well-known rugby  \n                    player, creates a real stir, and it looks like  \n                    the doctor's luck is changing for the better.  \n                    Mr Sharpe is furious, and does his best to turn  \n                    the locals against the doctor and his van -  \n                    although Mrs Sharpe is rather taken with the  \n                    new arrival.

Date: December 2007\n* Publisher: Penguin Group (USA)\n* Format: MP3 Book\n\n* Duration: 4 hours, 48 minutes (equivalent to 4 audio CDs)\n* ISBN-13: 9781429586191\n* ISBN: 1429586192\n* Edition Description: Abridged\n\nThe candid memoir of one of the most effective, controversial figures in modern politics\n\nVery few people are on the fence about Tom DeLay, who was nicknamed the Hammer for his hard-charging, take-no-prisoners style of leadership. Liberals despise him, but for conservatives he's a hero-one of the architects of the 1994 Republican revolution. For twelve years afterward, he was the driving force of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn this eagerly awaited memoir, DeLay will share fascinating stories from his entire career, starting with his early, raucous days in Texas; his personal conversion to Christ and how that changed his personal and political life; his work with other rebels to sow the seeds of the shocking 1994 takeover; and his ascension to the top leadership in the House. He offers a behind-the-scenes view of the most talked-about stories of the past decade, involving George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and many others.\n\nDeLay will also discuss his victories against the odds with the slimmest of margins; his passionate dedication to abused and neglected children; and his battle to fend off a ten-year barrage of malicious and frivolous allegations of wrongdoing, which ultimately led to his decision to resign from Congress.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, DeLay will unveil a blueprint agenda for the countrys next group of elected leaders, and show conservatives how to make it a reality.\n\n4 cd's ripped at 128kbps. abridged version ( only version available)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2d58f25376d0275629c670ee26a956461adb7d","amp;dn":"Tom+DeLay+-+No+Retreat%2C+No+Surrender","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2d58f25376d0275629c670ee26a956461adb7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,45,88,242,83,118,208,39,86,41,198,112,238,38,169,86,70,26,219,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

For this unusual set, 14 different singers had opportunities to interpret one or two Carter compositions while joined by a fine quintet consisting of cornetist Warren Vache, pianist Chris Neville, bassist Steve LaSpina, drummer Sherman Ferguson and Carter himself (88 at the time!) on alto. The ambitious program includes five Carter songs that were receiving their world premiere; in addition Carter also wrote or co-wrote the lyrics to nine of the pieces. The singers all show respect for the melody and words with Jon Hendricks being playful on &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie,&quot; Joe Williams quite touching on &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; and a weakened Peggy Lee making a memorable cameo on &quot;I See You.&quot; The vocalists consistently seem quite inspired by the unique project. There are many short Carter and Warren Vache solos and, even with the emphasis on ballads, there is more variety than one might expect. The well-conceived tribute (which also has fine appearances by Dianne Reeves, Carmen Bradford, Kenny Rankin, Marlena Shaw, Diana Krall, Billy Stritch, Shirley Horn, Bobby Short, Ruth Brown, Weslia Whitfield and Nancy Marano) is easily recommended.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Only Trust Your Heart - Dianne Reeves (5:28)\t\n2.All That Jazz - Carmen Bradford and Kenny Rankin (4:53) \t\n3.I Was Wrong - Joe Williams (4:21) \t\n4.Rain - Marlena Shaw (4:58)\n5.Cow-Cow Boogie - Jon Hendricks (5:32)\n6.Fresh Out of Love - Diana Krall (5:37) \t\n7.Speak Now - Billy Stritch (4:54 )\n8.A Kiss from You - Shirley Horn (5:27)\n9.You Bring Out the Best in Me - Bobby Short (4:15) \t\n10.My Kind of Trouble Is You - Ruth Brown (5:46)\t\n11.When Lights Are Low - Weslia Whitfield (4:05) \t\n12.Lonely Woman - Nancy Marano (6:33)\n13.Key Largo - Carmen Bradford (4:32)\t\n14.We Were in Love - Dianne Reeves and Joe Williams (6:00)\n15.I See You - Peggy Lee (4:48)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68936ea829a4a278cd6231238f9ec2f20f9e1f54","amp;dn":"Benny+Carter+and+VA.+-+Songbook+%281995%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68936ea829a4a278cd6231238f9ec2f20f9e1f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,147,110,168,41,164,162,120,205,98,49,35,143,158,194,242,15,158,31,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

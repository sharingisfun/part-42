Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, this is the only one that has survived.\nWhy did an ancient people go to these incredible lengths to create such a monument? And how did they go about it?\nPyramid - Beyond Imagination will not just tell you, it will show you. Based on the latest archaeological discoveries, and combining dramatic reconstruction with state-of-the-art CGI, Pyramid reveals how the mighty structure of the Great Pyramid was built.\nThe program follows worker Nakht as he is conscripted from his village to work on the Great Pyramid and moves his way up through the ranks to become a senior overseer. Through his eyes we see the construction of the greatest tomb known to man.\nBrilliantly polished casing stones clad the pyramid and the top sparkles with a gold capstone. The base covers 13 acres and is level to within less than an inch. It is aligned to the four points of the compass to near perfect precision. Inside, intricate networks of passageways lead to three chambers. In one the King will be laid to rest in a vast granite sarcophagus along with unimaginable riches. Here, he will become a medium for all his subjects between heaven and earth, god and man, life and death and all order will depend upon him.\nMany engineers believe that even with the help of 21st century technology, they still could not build anything like the Great Pyramid. This accuracy is phenomenal in any epoch, and an almost supernatural feat for the ancient Egyptians.\nFor 4,500 years, men have reeled before this most extraordinary of all human monuments - and asked how and why it was built.\n\nVoice of Nakht : Omar Sharif\nWritten and Directed by Jonathan Stamp\nExecutive Producer : Laurence Rees\nA BBC/Discovery Channel/NDR Germany Co-Production in association with TBS\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/5079/mrwp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/5079/mrwp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2959/wudl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2959/wudl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/4893/vfbg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/4893/vfbg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1527/qrnb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1527/qrnb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7042/xeue.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7042/xeue.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/7169/5uea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/7169/5uea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/7199/uy55.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/7199/uy55.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/510/fbpl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/510/fbpl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7159/x7gg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7159/x7gg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2237/jkxn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2237/jkxn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/2549/p5g7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/2549/p5g7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2269/ngdk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2269/ngdk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/6602/70wq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/6602/70wq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/4892/71j5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/4892/71j5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2074/8kgb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2074/8kgb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5060/0zl4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5060/0zl4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2101 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:52.040\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 821 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6c1f43f4528b0deabea084b3d1b142de7cc1ec","amp;dn":"BBC+Pyramid+Beyond+Imagination+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6c1f43f4528b0deabea084b3d1b142de7cc1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,108,31,67,244,82,139,13,234,190,160,132,179,209,177,66,222,124,193,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

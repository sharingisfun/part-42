This was a 10 inch vinyl single that seemed a good idea at the time but wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit into any jukeboxes so had a limited appeal. He stems from what became known as the Thames Delta blues scene during the Seventies. Scores of fine blues outfits spilled out from the area at that time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mickey JuppÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Legend, Dr Feelgood, The Kursaal Flyers, Eddie and the Hot Rods etc. So now Roy plays mainly solo in clubs and around the festival circuit across the UK. Like others before him heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stretching out and probing into areas where blues and British folk tradition meet, increasingly playing established, highly rated acoustic gigs and festivals in an attempt to prove his worth in a genre where songs demand a meaningful lyric.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77f0efdfebcc31337d975c96d0d399dbcda0556","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Roy+Mette+-+12+Bars+And+The+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77f0efdfebcc31337d975c96d0d399dbcda0556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,127,14,253,254,188,195,19,55,217,117,201,109,13,57,157,188,218,5,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Known as Pete to his friends and simply as Gunn to his enemies, he did his job in a calm cool way. He got his tips and cautions from Lieutenant Jacoby (Herschel Bernardi), a coffee drinking pal from the police. Also providing tips was &quot;Mother&quot; (Hope Emerson) of her self-titled nightclub. Working at the nightclub as a singer was Edie Hart (Lola Albright), his girlfriend. This was one of the first television shows to have its own original score and it was the first to feature modern jazz for a soundtrack. Previously, producers used generic music scores that were used in many television productions. RCA released an album of music from &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; featuring the title song and other pieces. It reached #1 on Billboard&amp;#039;s chart, stayed there ten weeks, and stayed on the list for the next two years. It was so successful that RCA put together a sequel. Henry Mancini received an Emmy nomination for the theme and won two Grammys for the album.\n\n1. The Kill   9/22/1958 \nA gang attempts to extort money from Mother.

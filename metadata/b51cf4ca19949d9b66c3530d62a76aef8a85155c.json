This project consists of the Gorillaz music itself and an extensive fictional universe depicting a &quot;virtual band&quot; of comic book characters. This band is composed of four animated members: 2D (lead vocalist, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar and occasional vocals) and Russel Hobbs  (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Their style is a composition of multiple musical genres, with a large number of influences including: dub, hip hop, alternative rock, electronic and pop music.\n\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51cf4ca19949d9b66c3530d62a76aef8a85155c","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Greatest+Hits+%5Bmp3-320-2010%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51cf4ca19949d9b66c3530d62a76aef8a85155c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,28,244,202,25,148,157,155,102,195,83,13,98,167,106,239,138,133,21,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

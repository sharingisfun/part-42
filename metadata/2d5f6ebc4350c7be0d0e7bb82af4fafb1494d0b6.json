Setting Global Illumination to medium is recommended if you are experiencing low frame rate.\n- The new 'Reflections' option is designed for high-end configurations only. Please disable this option if you are experiencing low frame rate.\n- AMD dual-core processor with Windows XP (for users who have not installed SP3): you may experience a fast flickering of the in-game menu items. To work around this problem, install the AMD - Dual-Core Optimizer available on the AMD website.\n- AMD or nVidia Dual-GPU / Crossfire / SLI cards: in order to avoid graphical issues, you will have to manually disable the multi-GPU modes of your video drivers prior to running the game under the DX9 environment.\n- In some isolated cases activating the Crossfire multi-GPU technology on a mobile Radeon HD6990M from Alienware results in a performance drop compared to a single GPU of the same setup.\n- Notes regarding Windows XP support\n- Due to limitations of the engine and multithreading management in Windows XP, the performance with Windows XP may be lower than the performance obtained with the same hardware configuration using a more recent version of Windows. Please use a more recent version of Windows for a better experience.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Unpack the release\n2. Run GRFS1.8.exe and install\n3.

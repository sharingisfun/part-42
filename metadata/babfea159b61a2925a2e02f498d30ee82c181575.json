She and partner Tom have gone legit, and now she is a respectable small-town citizen, owner of the local general store--and bored out of her mind. Frustration with the tedium of normal life and her own discontents gets her into trouble after she loses the store in a poker game. Mr. Winters, the security mogul who won it, offers a proposition she can't refuse: to test the new security robots on his train. He is willing to pay. In a fit of recklessness, Daisy takes the job. Kibuishi's art and storytelling in his Wild West confection convey a sense that Daisy's world isn't created as much as spontaneously unfolding as you read. His art is a hybrid of the best aspects of both manga and American animation yet is more unique than that suggests. It expresses Daisy's restrained frustration and Tom's aw-shucks likability and also the wide-open space of the Wild West.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babfea159b61a2925a2e02f498d30ee82c181575","amp;dn":"Daisy+Kutter+-+The+Last+Train","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babfea159b61a2925a2e02f498d30ee82c181575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,191,234,21,155,97,162,146,90,46,2,244,152,211,14,232,44,24,21,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

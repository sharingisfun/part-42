These plants are essential components of our physiologies--tangible reminders of cross-kingdom signaling--and key not only to vibrant physical health and prevention of illness but also to soothing and awakening the troubled spirit.\n\nBlending traditional herbal medicine with history, mythology, clinical practice, and recent findings in physiology and biochemistry, herbalist Guido Mase explores the three classes of plants necessary for the healthy functioning of our bodies and minds--aromatics, bitters, and tonics. He explains how bitter plants ignite digestion, balance blood sugar, buffer toxicity, and improve metabolism; how tonic plants normalize the functions of our cells and nourish the immune system; and how aromatic plants relax tense organs, nerves, and muscles and stimulate sluggish systems, whether physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. He reveals how wild plants regulate our heart variability rate and adjust the way DNA is read by our cells, controlling the self-destructive tendencies that lead to chronic inflammation or cancer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ee913c3e9b63460a5d3faecba319ce147bbe28","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Medicine+Solution%3A+Healing+with+Aromatic%2C+Bitter+plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ee913c3e9b63460a5d3faecba319ce147bbe28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,238,145,60,62,155,99,70,10,93,63,174,203,163,25,206,20,123,190,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

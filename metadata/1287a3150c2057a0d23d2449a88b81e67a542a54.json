The author presents a new ecological approach to the understanding of dog behaviour, demonstrating how dogs can be the subject of rigorous and productive scientific study without the need to confine them to a laboratory environment.\nDog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition starts with an overview of the conceptual and methodological issues associated with the study of the dog, followed by a brief description of their role in human society--almost a third of human families share their daily life with a dog! An evolutionary perspective is then introduced with a summary of current research into the process of domestication. The central part of the book is devoted to issues relating to the cognitive aspects of behavior which have received particular attention in recent years from both psychologists and ethologists. The book's final chapters introduce the reader to many novel approaches to dog behavior, set in the context of behavioral development and genetics.\nDirections for future research are highlighted throughout the text which also incorporates links to human and primate research by drawing on homologies and analogies in both evolution and behavior. The book will therefore be of relevance and use to anyone with an interest in behavioral ecology including graduate students of animal behavior and cognition, as well as a more general audience of dog enthusiasts, biologists, psychologists and sociologists.\n\nMore details\nDog behaviour, evolution, and cognition\nBy Adam MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³si, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡m MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­klÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³si\nEdition: illustrated\nPublished by Oxford University Press, 2007\nISBN 0199295859, 9780199295852\n274 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1287a3150c2057a0d23d2449a88b81e67a542a54","amp;dn":"Dog+Behaviour%2C+Evolution%2C+and+Cognition+-+Adam+Mikloso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1287a3150c2057a0d23d2449a88b81e67a542a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,135,163,21,12,32,87,160,210,61,36,73,168,139,129,230,122,84,42,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The world runs on ideas. Good things rarely \nhappen accidentally. Long before electric lights or television or heart surgery or \neven the wheel came to be, they existed as thoughts in somebody's mind.\n\nWhen ideas are first formed, they are often considered to be of little importance. \n(&quot;And what will you do once you're up in the air, Mr. Wright? A waste of time!&quot;) But as years pass and an idea begins to be accepted, it can change our lives. Sometimes it changes the very foundation of our society.\n\nWhere do good ideas come from? You're probably not a mad genius working in a laboratory, churning out miracle drugs and magic potions for a living. But that doesn't matter. Many of the extraordinary inventions we use in our world today came from quite ordinary people.And those same ordinary people can get good ideas to improve their financial situation, their relationships with others, their circumstances at work and home, and countless other things. Ideas can come to anyone who's willing to seek them out.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n\nThe Great American Dream   \t\nA Simple Way to Start Ideas Coming   \t\nWinning IdeasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½How to Find Them  \t\nOne Key to Getting Good Ideas   \t\nA Sure Way to Clog Up a Creative Mind   \nWhat You Need Besides a Good Idea \t\nPlayful Ways to Get Ideas \t\nSuperman Syndrome  \t\nHow to Strengthen Your Creative Muscle \t\nA Sure Way to Kill CreativityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½And How to Avoid It \t\nHow to Get Big Money for Your Ideas   \t\nHow to Make Ideas Valuable  \t\nHow to Make Your Ideas Succeed \t\nProjection \t\nGetting More from Your Mind  \t\nThe Outside Advantage \t\nHow to Protect Your Ideas \t\nJumping the Creativity Gap \t\nThinking Traps That Kill Creativity   \t\nCreative Hype \t\nOne Reason Your Good Ideas May Fail .. .\nCooked Goose  \t\nA Sure-Fire Creative Technique  \t\nHow to Turn Mistakes into Opportunities \t\nMental Practice \t\nA Tool for Opening Your Creative Mind .. .\nHow to Get More from Your Dreams \t\nFruit from Nuts \t\nHard Work? \t\nTwo Brains in One Skull  \t\nWhy Its So Hard to Get\nYour Ideas Accepted   \t\nA Logical Creative Technique \t\nToll PositionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Keep the Money Coming .. .\nMind Joggers to Increase Creativity  \t\nHow Mother Nature Can Increase Creativity \t\nAh Ha! \t\nCreative Solutions Made to Order   \t\nA Creative Thinking Technique That Never Fails \t\nBeware of the Crackpot \t\nMetamorphosis \t\nHow to Gain a Creative Point of View \t\nWhere Most Ideas Come From  \t\nThe Most Important Creative Skill   \t\nVisual Brainstorming  \t\nHow Intuition Can Increase Your Creative Potential  \t\nSwimming Upstream   \t\nThe Biggest Barrier to Creativity   \t\nA Noncreative Habit to Avoid   \t\nPointy-Headed People\nNeed Custom-Made Hats \t\nHow to Avoid a Creators Worst Enemy  \t\nCreative Cliches \t\nTips tor Dealing With the Right People   \t\nHow to Avoid Having Your Idea Stolen   \t\nA Fact Everybody Forgets   \t\nDon't Overlook This Technique of Creative Thinking \t\nHow to Submit an Idea   \t\nConstipated Thinking \t\nHow to Increase Creative Output Without Extra Work   \t\nDo YOU Do II?   \t\nFinding the Essence \t\nVerbal Agreements Don't Protect Ideas \t\nBrainstorming \t\nHow Ideas Are Lost  \t\nHow to Get More Reward\nfor Your Creative Effort \t\n\n\n\nOTHER BOOKS INCLUDED:\nHow To Be Creative\nCreativity At Work\nCreativity - Maximize Your Brainpower - 1000 New Ways to Boost Your Mental Fitness\nA Mental Fitness Program for Maximizing Creativity and Achieving Success\nA Guide For Creative Thinking By Brian Tracy\n101 Activities for Teaching Creativity and Problem Solving\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7516dc564d433fbc5ee5308ff30fc1a4e0873daa","amp;dn":"WAKE+UP+YOUR+CREATIVE+GENUIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7516dc564d433fbc5ee5308ff30fc1a4e0873daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,22,220,86,77,67,63,188,94,229,48,143,243,15,193,164,224,135,61,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In 1967, Rolling Stone was founded in San Francisco, California, by Jann Wenner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who is still the magazine's chief editor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and music critic, Ralph J. Gleason.\n\nRolling Stone was known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by the enigmatic and controversial gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.[2]\n\nIn recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content, including in-depth political stories. It also has expanded content to include coverage of financial and banking issues. As a result, the magazine has seen its circulation increase and its reporters invited as experts to network television programs of note.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932fb51185d43b191db2df3bdf9fcccd9aa77491","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stone+USA+-+8+May+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932fb51185d43b191db2df3bdf9fcccd9aa77491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,47,181,17,133,212,59,25,29,178,223,59,223,159,204,205,154,167,116,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

DeRosa then calls into the hotline to hash it out. After that chat is over, Bailey Jay joins Ant in the bar to discuss the waxing that Jon Stewart will be getting and when the waxing begins it is... well, hilarious. After Jon Stewart is cue balled by Bailey, Ant sits and talks with them about relationships, Jon's life in Ireland, and they talk about Bailey's marriage and sex life. They also debate the word &quot;tranny,&quot; talk about Jimmy's Vice show, and recollect on past pool parties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaabd1937143128180c921c8245a108b3b31a91c","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-11+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaabd1937143128180c921c8245a108b3b31a91c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,171,209,147,113,67,18,129,128,201,33,200,36,90,16,139,59,49,169,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

As a member of four Red WingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Stanley CupÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning teams, McCarty played the role of enforcer from 1993 to 2004 and returning again in 2008 and 2009. His Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grind LineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with teammates Kris Draper and Kirk Maltby physically overmatched some of the best offensive lines in the NHL, but he was more than just a brawler: his 127 career goals included several of the highlight variety, including an inside-out move against Philadelphia in the clinching game of the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. As colorful a character as any NHL player, he has arms adorned with tattoos, and he was the lead singer in the hard rock band Grinder during the offseason. Yet this autobiography details what may have endeared him most to his fans: the honest, open way he has dealt with his struggles in life off the ice. Whether dealing with substance abuse, bankruptcy, divorce, or the death of his father, Darren McCarty has always seemed to persevere.\n\nPublisher: Triumph Books; Reprint edition (October 1, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1629370452\nISBN-13: 978-1629370453\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAbout the Author\n\nDarren McCarty played parts of 15 seasons in the NHLÃ¢â‚¬â€all but two with the Detroit Red Wings.

A real, heartfelt book.\nBy Brittani Halaquist on November 16, 2013\nAs a Red Wings fan, it was always exciting to see 25 on the ice kicking ass. You always wondered who he was going to drop the gloves with. I enjoyed this book because it's difficult to remember that celebrities, and star athletes are real people with real problems. It actually disgusts me to hear how low people will go to take advantage of someone and their status. Just because Darren was a nice guy doesn't mean that the scum that he hung around with could rob and cheat him.\nNice to see that his family is strong and he's got an awesome structure to base the rest of his life. I only hope that he is successful.\nI recommend this book to everyone, but especially to people who have their own struggles. Keep fighting and stay strong!\n\n\nI wanted to give this 3 stars, but....\nBy T. Moore on December 5, 2013\nOk, I admit it. I've been a fan of No. 25 for ages. Used to love watching the Grind line take on the first line of any team and just bottle them up. I've always had respect for the game the played and the hard work they did. So, I must confess I am rating this at five b/c of the feelings of nostalgia and remembered fun it raised. McCarty talks about fights and goals and games and I remember watching those and cheering my head off. The book is well-worth the price of admission for that alone....but....\n\nHe shares a deep look at his world behind all of this and shares his difficulties, his pain. I respect the words of the man so much b/c he is simply telling it. There's a quiet dignity in him that comes through. He's not looking for pity or even understanding. He just needs to tell it. It is a great reminder that our heroes are just as human as we are and we should never lose sight of this.\n\nWhy did I originally say 3? At first I was comparing it in a literary sense to other books I've read. I think it lacks a little in organization and it tends to wander a bit, but then I realized that this book is a conversation. McCarty is talking to us, not trying to write a great novel. A lot of his personality comes through in this style and honestly, upon reflection, I appreciate that so much more than a biographical style.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book and appreciate how hard it must've been to write.\n\nThank you for doing it, Mr. McCarty....and good luck on your last fight, sir. You are a courageous man to do it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec545c1664389a6faf19af0bee68ea2d56f624d7","amp;dn":"My+Last+Fight+The+True+Story+of+a+Hockey+Rock+Star%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec545c1664389a6faf19af0bee68ea2d56f624d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,84,92,22,100,56,154,111,175,25,175,11,238,104,234,45,86,246,36,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

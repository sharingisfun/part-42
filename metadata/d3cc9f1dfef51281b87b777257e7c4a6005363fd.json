This book is invaluable for anyone who wishes to promote mathematical thinking in others or for anyone who has always wondered what lies at the core of mathematics.\n\n \n\nThinking Mathematically reveals the processes at the heart of mathematics and demonstrates how to encourage and develop them. Extremely practical, it involves the reader in questions so that subsequent discussions speak to immediate experience. \n\n\nThe text has been updated with 77 fresh problems matched to curriculum topics together with links between those topics and the original problems. There is a new preface describing the origins and uses of the first edition, and a new chapter correlates mathematical processes with the natural powers that every learner has already demonstrated in learning to speak.\n\nJune 2010\nPublisher: Addison Wesley\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cc9f1dfef51281b87b777257e7c4a6005363fd","amp;dn":"Thinking+Mathematically+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cc9f1dfef51281b87b777257e7c4a6005363fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,204,159,29,254,245,18,129,184,123,119,114,87,231,196,166,0,83,99,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

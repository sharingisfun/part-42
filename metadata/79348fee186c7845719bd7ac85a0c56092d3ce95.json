John Fogerty's cutting, raspy voice bore echoes of Howlin' \nWolf and Little Richard as he delivered lyrics that alternately celebrated and bemoaned \na working man's life, much like Merle Haggard and other '60s country artists. \n\nThat the strong New Orleans swamp-rock flavor seemed so natural \n(Californian Fogerty's bayou tales were pure flights of fancy) \nwas a testament to the strength of CCR's musical vision. \nThe way they put a respectful but contemporary twist on \nDale Hawkins's &quot;Suzie Q&quot; and the chilling &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; \nshows that they knew enough about the past to step confidently into rock &amp; roll's future.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79348fee186c7845719bd7ac85a0c56092d3ce95","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+%5BBox+Set%5D+6+cd+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79348fee186c7845719bd7ac85a0c56092d3ce95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,52,143,238,24,108,120,69,113,155,215,172,133,160,197,96,146,211,206,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

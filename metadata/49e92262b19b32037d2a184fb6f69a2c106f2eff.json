It's because the movie is 2:45 long, and it has many action scenes which I didn't want to lose its details. But believe me the this brought a higher quality release so enjoy.\n\nThe source was ORIGINAL BluRay(41GB) so it makes the quality even better. what's important is, the movie has 2channel original AC3 from BluRay. But if you like the 6channel sound, I've included another audio file which you can download separately if you like. this is done for people which prefer to download 2ch sound which is about 750mb less size. If you like this way, I could do this for other releases too. you can just drag-drop the sound to the player after you load the movie or you can use mkvmerge to attach 6ch audio to original movie. The 6channel audio is also UNTOUCHED BluRay version.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAAIoaAgi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAAIoaAgi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAiDaAGi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAiDaAGi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAAieaaGi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAAieaaGi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaAIFAagi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaAIFAagi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAaiGAAGI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAaiGAAGI&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAiiAagi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaAiiAagi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baaibaAgi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baaibaAgi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : Matroska MKV\nFormat version                           : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size                                : 4.58 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 45mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 3 973 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                                   : HEVC\nFormat/Info                              : High Efficiency Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 2h 45mn\nBit rate                                 : 3 670 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 536 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\n\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nFormat profile                           : Dolby Digital\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nDuration                                 : 2h 45mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nStream size                              : 265 MiB (6%)\nTitle                                    : Stereo\nLanguage                                 : English\n\n\n\nSubtitle\nFormat                                   : UTF-8\nLanguage                                 : English\n\n\nNote:\nThis Release is ReEncoded using next-generation video format/codec x265. it's one of the best and more advanced than current popular format x264. It also named HEVC which stands for High-Efficient Video Codec.\nif you want to play this smoothly, you need to use a device/PC with at least dual-core processor. \nYou have to update your player to latest version. Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. Many players have native support for the codec, live MPC-HC(free) or PowerDVD 14(paid).\nAnyway, there's a video samples so you can download, check the quality and check if you can play it or not. it's very easy though. believe me, this format will be so popular in one or two years so you have to deal with it anyway.

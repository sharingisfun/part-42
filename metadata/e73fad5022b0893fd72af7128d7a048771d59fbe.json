Milsap bends the rules slightly, finding space for '60s Motown (Jimmy Ruffin's &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot;) and '70s Philly soul (the Stylistics' &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;), but this is still super-smooth adult contemporary fueled by his gossamer electric piano and grounded by his still supple croon. Apart from &quot;Georgia on My Mind,&quot; which is a bit funkier than expected, and the inclusion of the newly written title track (a swaying, slow-dance bit of mythologizing of sweet teenage summers), there's nothing surprising in either the song selection or presentation but if there were, that'd go against the very spirit of this project. Summer Number Seventeen is supposed to comfort and soothe, to bring back rose-colored memories of any number of possible pasts, and in that regard it succeeds handsomely. \n\n\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Summer Number Seventeen\n02.It's All In The Game\n03.Personality\n04.Tears On My Pillow\n05.What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted\n06.You Make Me Feel Brand New\n07.Mack The Knife\n08.Mustang Sally\n09.Georgia On My Mind\n10.I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\n11.Make Up  (Feat.

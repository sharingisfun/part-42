His act of revenge leaves its passengers stuck 8500 feet in the air as a vicious storm approaches, threatening to weaken the already fragile cable.  \n\nStrangely, I wanted to see this but had a hard time finding it.  Now I'm sharing the wealth.  I'm not sure where or what this was ripped from, but no DVD or (official) VHS version was ever released -- so be content that this exists.  If you enjoy films like the Towering Inferno this should be right up your alley.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b623e051ce6a193ac7e5f4c906448c35704290ca","amp;dn":"Skyway+to+Death+%281974+TV+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b623e051ce6a193ac7e5f4c906448c35704290ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,35,224,81,206,106,25,58,199,229,244,201,6,68,140,53,112,66,144,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

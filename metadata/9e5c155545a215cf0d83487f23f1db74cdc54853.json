Using a lie-detector to quiz them, every time one is caught in a lie the other is punished with a surge of electricity. Clark and Lois discover that they are missing and pose as a couple to lure the kidnapper out of hiding. Chloe and Jimmy survive, answering the questions to the jewelers satisfaction, who sets them free; unfortunately, Lois is kidnapped by the jeweler. Clark goes to her rescue, but a kryptonite bracelet the jeweler wears weakens Clark. During the line of question, Lois admits that she loves Clark. Before Clark can answer he manages to strip the bracelet off the jeweler and then knock him unconscious. Later, Lois chocks up her &quot;love&quot; for Clark as nothing more than a lie, which she was able to accomplish by slipping the lie-detector electrode off her finger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e5c155545a215cf0d83487f23f1db74cdc54853","amp;dn":"Smallville+-+S08E05+-+XviD+-+%5BRO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e5c155545a215cf0d83487f23f1db74cdc54853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,92,21,85,69,162,21,207,13,131,72,127,35,241,219,116,205,197,72,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The group consists of a dog, &quot;Bandit&quot; a.k.a. &quot;1&quot;; a cat, &quot;Tinker&quot; a.k.a. &quot;2&quot;; and a rabbit, &quot;Pirate&quot; a.k.a. &quot;3&quot;, who were all kidnapped from a nearby city and encased in robotic armor. They were also given a limited ability to speak through skull implants. Their body armor fields numerous weapons, including mine laying devices, machine guns and razor claws. It has been implied by Grant Morrison[citation needed] that We3 (Weapons II, III, IV) were actually part of the Weapon Plus Program that created Captain America - Weapon I, Wolverine - Weapon X, and Fantomex - Weapon XIII.\n\nWe3 meet and overcome numerous hazards on their flight to freedom, as they are pursued by the full might of the military, including other engineered animal weapons. They also encounter civilians, with varying reactions.\n\nONE OF MY FAVORITE COMICS\n\nALL NEW SCANS\n\nNY GRANT MORRISON AND FRANK QUITELY\n\nPUBLISHED BY DC,VERTIGO IMPRINT \n\nENJOY AND SEED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b7382d14d72ecd8dd1cea844c3a0d20eeffab86","amp;dn":"WE3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b7382d14d72ecd8dd1cea844c3a0d20eeffab86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,115,130,209,77,114,236,216,221,28,234,132,76,58,13,32,238,255,171,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Among them are American agent Andy Hui (Andy On), Taiwanese cop Vanness Chang (Vanness Wu), and local lawman Lok. They are greeted by Hong Kong police commander Hon Sun (Simon Yam). The heavily armed convoy taking Puma to court is attacked by a ruthless team of North Korean agents, led by international terrorist Petros Davinci (Michael Biehn). Petros is seeking revenge for his brother in arms, who was killed by Puma and his brother, 'Tiger' Duen. At Petros' side is his fierce enforcer, Ko (Jun-ho Heo), and a lethal lady sniper, Song (Maggie Q). After Puma is snatched, the Interpol team insists on tracking down Petros themselves. Hon Sun rejects their request and places the team in the care of veteran police officer Kong Long (Sammo Hung). A burned out cop who has never come to terms with either his personal or professional history, Long Kong is reluctant to get involved. Finally, inspired by his young charges, he rises to the occasion, and leads the Interpol team on their quest for Petros and his team. The mean streets of Hong Kong form a backdrop for a battle of wills, wits, and urban warfare.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is to all you cock smokes out there! ;)\n\nAnyways, after alot of talk and everything, \nWe are getting tired of your complaining.\n\nSO FOR THIS TORRENT (because it's only a repeack)\nWE GIVE ALL CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADER!\n\nThanks\nSMiL3\n\n\n\nsmil3rg[at]hushmail.com\n\nGET YOUR SEEDBOX AT AtomicServers!\n\nSites you can find us:\n\nMost Public\n    &amp;\nMost Private\n    ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d04f41c61b89b6a6374d4cd694e1d142abe3ac51","amp;dn":"Dragon.Squad.2005.DvDrip-SMiL3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d04f41c61b89b6a6374d4cd694e1d142abe3ac51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,79,65,198,27,137,182,166,55,77,76,214,148,225,209,66,171,227,172,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

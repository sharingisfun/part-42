In addition to exploring some of Fidel Castro's questionable methods of achieving absolute power, Almendros and Ulla's film also takes a closer look at previous accounts that may have been hastily dismissed in the past.\n\nDespite a well-established record of mass torture and imprisonment of thousands of law-abiding citizens for political reasons, it sometimes appears that the regime of Ferdinand Castro in Cuba has gotten away with its crimes. So completely is this the case that, to leftists all over the world, the name &quot;Castro&quot; still has a heroic ring to it. Consequently it has become almost taboo to discuss the horrific misdeeds of the &quot;hero's&quot; regime, but the makers of this documentary intend to set the record straight, and in a series of interviews with survivors of Castro's prisons, they reveal many surprising facts about the dictator's perfidious regime. Many of those interviewed were formerly high officials in Cuba's communist government who fell from favor. They know (literally) where the bodies are buried.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a0c9719c67bc108e24e9e807da5f0b83533883","amp;dn":"Nobody+Listened+%28Nadie+Escuchaba%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a0c9719c67bc108e24e9e807da5f0b83533883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,160,201,113,156,103,188,16,142,36,233,232,7,218,95,11,131,83,56,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

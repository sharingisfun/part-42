Ã‚Â°\n\n \n   Submarine Titans, a futuristic real-time strategy game, dares to go\n   where no RTS has gone before - plunging players deep into an immense\n   and spellbinding underwater world, where three future civilizations are\n   locked in a battle for supremacy. In the year 2047, the Clark Comet\n   strikes the earth&amp;#039;s surface with such astounding force that life as we\n   know it is virtually wiped out. Taking to subterranean vaults and\n   makeshift undersea installations, several thousand humans escape the\n   blight of the comet and the ensuing ravages of a weather system that\n   reaps havoc on land.\n   \n   Over the next century, humankind slowly adapts to their oceanic habitat\n   and evolves into two rival civilizations: the White Sharks - who hunger\n   for dominance over the underwater universe; and the technologically\n   advanced and environmentally protective Black Octopi, who will go to\n   any extremes necessary to remain in balance with the Earth. As the\n   Sharks and Octopi gather resources and build their forces to prepare\n   for an inevitable clash, an alien race uncoils itself from within the\n   resource-laden crater deep on the ocean floor. In the year 2115, all\n   three races erupt in an epic struggle that seems destined to destroy\n   man&amp;#039;s final bid for survival.\n   \n   Submarine Titans&amp;#039; addictive and compelling gameplay enables players to\n   command one of three civilizations in a range of fully 3D battlescapes.\n   The game environment is divided into 5 depth levels in which players\n   and their opponents can hide behind or under 3D terrain for\n   unparalleled offensive and defensive maneuvering. According to the\n   developer, players can opt to have a computer AI assist them, by taking\n   over mundane tasks, so that they can concentrate on the areas of the\n   game they most enjoy. With the use of the Scenario-editor, players will\n   have the opportunity to create their own scenarios and maintain the\n   same control over elements as the game designers themselves.\n   \n   These features combined with Ellipse&amp;#039;s revolutionary dual control\n   interface, which gives players the option of controlling individual\n   units or entire groups, as well as simultaneously planning production\n   and launching attacks against opponents, promises to take Submarine\n   Titans way beyond anything other games will be offering in the near\n   future.\n   \n   Supporting 3D sound and resolutions of 800 x 600 to 1280 x 1024\n   graphics, Submarine Titans will submerge players into an iridescent\n   world of fantasy and adventure. Multiplayer action over LAN and\n   Internet will allow up to 24 players - including 8 AI opponents and 8\n   spectators - to watch and take part, as the action unfolds in this\n   extraordinary aquatic adventure.\n\n   Find more info at www.subtitans.com\n\n   Ripped: movies and music, don&amp;#039;t expect an addon.\n\n    \n                                 ? ??\n            ÃƒÅ“?

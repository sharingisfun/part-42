Typically, content does not include anything to do with newer 3D based consoles, but may include older first generation 3D games from the late 16-bit era.\n\nIssue #3 was the first &quot;theme&quot; issue produced by Old Skool Games. Being that we were close to independance day, the country was turning 229, and we had troops in other countries that I felt were often unappreciated for what they do, I decided to make an issue dedicated to them, full of nothing but military game reviews. Although at the time, I had designed the red white and blue cover graphics specifically for use with the July issue and Platoon screenshot, I later decided that I would make the scheme standard and adopt them as official OSG colors. It wasn&amp;#039;t so much red blooded patriotism as it was a case of those colors working out great with my cover graphics. -(Zachary Bartels)\n\nThere are currently 5 issues in total, 4 published and one overdue issue that is near completion.\n\n=======================================\nOld Skool Games - Issue #3 - July 2005\n=======================================\nEditor in Chief - Zachary Bartels\nStaff Writers - Eric Ladd\nContributors - Carlos Hernandez, Chris Morley, Eric Wu, Tres Bradshaw\n\nGames Reviewed in This Issue:\nCombat, Contra, Contra III, Military Madness, PLATOON, P.O.W, Rambo\n\nArticles:\nLetter From the Editor (Thank you letter to all troops)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f68df769f9fcd679adb1f6d53a7180fda157e21","amp;dn":"Old+Skool+Games+-+Issue+%233+-+July+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f68df769f9fcd679adb1f6d53a7180fda157e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,104,223,118,159,159,205,103,154,219,31,109,83,167,24,15,218,21,126,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

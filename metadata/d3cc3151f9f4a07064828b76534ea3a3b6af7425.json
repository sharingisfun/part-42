This dissertation concentrated more on\nthe differences of anti-dumping laws than the very concept of dumping.\n\nFurther, I went on to define what dumping is and showed the effort of the\nWTO to curb this unfair trade practices. In doing this I discussed a brief\nreview of the history of dumping, that the first use of the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dumpingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was\nin 1868 in the Commerce and Financial Chronicle (VI. 326/I) where it was\nsaid, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew stock secretly issued (was) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dumpedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on the market for what it\nwould fetch.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But In the late 19th century dumping became part of the trade\npolicy of great European cartels, especially German cartels.\n\nFurther again, I discussed some of the reasons why companies indulge in\ndumping activity. These reasons included the following: that the dumping of\ngoods creates an artificial rather than a true comparative advantage, since the\nlower export price does not result from cost-efficiency; and that dumping is\ncaused by the isolation of the exporting country's market through high\nprotective barriers or lack of competition in the market of the exporting\ncountry, and so on.\n\nI went on to furnish a succinct definition of the concept of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dumping below\ncostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which can occur because the industry which is dumping possesses a\nstructural characteristic which enables it to export its products below the cost\nof production for a sustained period without going out of business, and\ndiscussed also its subdivision which are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dumping below average costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dumping below marginal costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nIn chapter 3 I delved into the discussion of the EU anti-dumping system\nbeginning with the different anti-dumping institutions (the Commission, the\nCouncil and the Member States, and so on) through the investigation\nprocesses, that is, how anti-dumping proceedings are initiated. Here the\nnumerous stages (like filing of complaints, the issuance of questionnaires, and\nverification visits) were discussed. How does the EU determine injury was\nalso looked at. A discussion of the concepts of normal and constructed value,the domestic market price was also looked at. I also explained how dumped\nproducts were the principle cause of material injury. I terminated this chapter\nwith a discussion of technical dumping which could be referred to as a\ncompany selling at a profit in a foreign market as opposed to unfair trade\npricing.\n\nChapter 4 discussed the US anti-dumping system. Here, just as I did in the\nprevious chapter, I began this chapter with the different anti-dumping\ninstitutions that exist in the US. The two main institutions that are vested with\nauthority to handle anti-dumping issues are the Department of Commerce and\nthe International Trade Commission. This chapter also discussed US antidumping\ninvestigation techniques in terms of the counselsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ role, how do antidumping\nduties are enforced, and the determination of anti-dumping duties,\nand so on. Also dumping determination was discussed under the umbrella of\nforeign market/home market value, a determination of sales below cost of\nproduction, and the very special way of calculating normal value involving\nimports from non-market economy countries. Material injury determination,\nthat is to be performed by the ITC was also discussed. This chapter covered\nhow the ITC determines material injury by sending questionnaires covering\nvarious areas like employment and profits to US producers and importers, and\nto foreign producers and exporters. The chapter ended with a look at technical\ndumping. Under US anti-dumping system technical dumping refers to a situation whereby foreign producers meet US prices but are below their\ndomestic price plus a mandated profit margin.\n\nFinally, the EU and the US anti-dumping law have a lot of issues in common.\nBeginning from the injustices meted to new exporters (under EU system) who\nare automatically brought under the highest levy that could be applied to the\nexporting country to the Department of CommerceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s practice of setting aside\ndeposit for small exporters who were not initially investigated. Again, the two\nsystems have existing laws which have tendencies inclined towards protecting\nown industry, and somewhat defeating or frustrating the original purpose of\nthe GATT anti-dumping law.\n\nI strongly suggest that the EU and US anti-dumping system introduce reforms\nto their laws that will be geared towards fair competition. If this is not done,\neventually the two systems will find themselves victims of the anticompetitive\npractice they have set up when developing economics all over the\nworld will begin to introduce their own anti-dumping laws.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cc3151f9f4a07064828b76534ea3a3b6af7425","amp;dn":"Comparative+Analysis+of+Anti-Dumping+Laws+by+Okiotor+OSIAH.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cc3151f9f4a07064828b76534ea3a3b6af7425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,204,49,81,249,244,160,112,100,130,139,118,83,78,163,163,182,175,116,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

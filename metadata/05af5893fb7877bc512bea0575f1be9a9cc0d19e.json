Her musical and song-writing approach is heavily influenced by the hard-edged, hard beat-driven rhythms common to many rock bands of her native Philadelphia, often featuring lyrics surrounding themes of lost love, criticisms of insincerity, the struggles and resolution of the American working class, and the quest for authenticity.\n\nSinner is a Studio album by the American Hard rock band Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, released June 13, 2006, by Blackheart Records Group. While most of the contents previously appeared on the Japan-only release Naked (2004), it is her first record of new material released in the United States since Pure and Simple in 1994. Singles released include &quot;A.C.D.C.&quot; (originally by Sweet) and &quot;Riddles&quot; (Jett's first-ever political song).\n\nAn edited &quot;clean&quot; version was also released. The CD also includes enhanced content, consisting of a lyrics sheet (in PDF format) and a video of the recording of &quot;A.C.D.C.&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05af5893fb7877bc512bea0575f1be9a9cc0d19e","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+%26+The+Blackhearts+-+A.C.D.C.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05af5893fb7877bc512bea0575f1be9a9cc0d19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,175,88,147,251,120,119,188,81,43,234,5,117,241,190,154,156,192,209,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

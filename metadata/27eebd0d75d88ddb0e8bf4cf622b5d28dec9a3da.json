Robert Glasper produced the collaboration. â€œI didnâ€™t want to do just a remix record,â€ Glasper noted when discussing the 11-song set. â€œMy idea was to show how Miles inspired people to make new art.â€ Knowing that â€œMiles didnâ€™t have one audience,â€ Glasper recruited a legion of diverse guest artists to add to the magic of the project including familiar collaborators like R&amp;B musicians Erykah Badu, Ledisi, Bilal and KING. They are joined by British soul singer-songwriter Laura Mvula; hip-hop producer Rashad Smith; Grammy-nominated Australian neo-soul quartet Hiatus Kaiyote, rapper/producer Illa J; jazz guitarist John Scofield, who collaborated with Davis; and the legendary Stevie Wonder.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.

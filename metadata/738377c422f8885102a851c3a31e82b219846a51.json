GTA: London was released on March 31, 1999 for DOS, Microsoft Windows. In April 1999, a version for the Sony PlayStation was released. The game uses the same game engine as Grand Theft Auto, thus giving the game graphics reminiscent of the aforementioned game, and the gameplay and game mechanics are also very much alike those found in GTA. Like GTA the mission pack is divided into sub-sections with short cutscenes in between. GTA: London is also notable for being the first ever Playstation expansion pack. \n\nInstead of fictional locations based on real-life cities as featured in the original Grand Theft Auto (Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City), the game takes place in London, in 1969, as the title implies. The player once again enters the role of a criminal looking to work his way up the career ladder of organized crime. \n\nThe temporal setting has been exploited through a number of cultural and historical references, including the appearance of a mod/James Bond-like character, and the usage of stereotypical Cockney slang. In-game dialogue included such memorable lines as &quot;Oi!, stop right there!&quot;, &quot;You're nicked!&quot; and &quot;You're brown bread!&quot; #i.e. You're dead#. \n\nSimilar to the bonuses found in Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, the player receives a large cash reward for running over a group of &quot;soap dodging hippies&quot; with a car without stopping or braking. Successfully performing the trick will be followed by a bold message reading &quot;KEEP LONDON TIDY!&quot; and a cash bonus. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrand Theft Auto - London: 1969 \nRelease Date: 04/30/99 \nGenre: Action Adventure \nDeveloper: DMA Design \nESRB Rating: M \nISO Size: 643 mb \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:738377c422f8885102a851c3a31e82b219846a51","amp;dn":"%5BPSX-PSP%5D+Grand+Theft+Auto+Mission+Pack+%231+London+1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"738377c422f8885102a851c3a31e82b219846a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,131,119,196,34,248,136,81,2,168,81,195,163,30,130,178,25,132,106,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Combining field recordings with Copeland's multi-instrumental work in an Assyrian studio, The Rhythmatist is light years ahead of his sophomorically amiable work as Klark Kent. The album and accompanying video didn't make much of a dent in any market, except among fellow drummers and die-hard Police fans. It's an unfortunate oversight, because its enthusiastic world music fusion has held up better than the other Police solo efforts of this period. The album as a whole focuses on (not surprisingly) the rhythm section of tastefully syncopated drums and percussion against a backdrop of atmospheric synthesizers. Ray Lema's chorused vocals over the pulsing beat of &quot;Koteja&quot; are absolutely hypnotic, while Copeland's dry narration after the clattering drum solo of &quot;Serengeti Long Walk&quot; is awkwardly endearing. ~ Paul Collins, All Music Guide\n\nRecording information: The Worried Rabbit, Nineveh, Assyria; Worried Rabbit, Nineveh, Assyria.\n\nAuthor: Thomas Aquinas.\n\nDirector: J.P.

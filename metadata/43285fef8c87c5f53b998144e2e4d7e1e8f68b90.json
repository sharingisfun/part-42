Moody | Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (August 2, 2007) | ISBN: 0123695481 | Pages: 1080 | PDF | 19 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nUnlike anything currently available in the market, Dr. Sally A. Moody and a team of world-renowned experts provide a groundbreaking view of developmental genetics that will influence scientific approaches in embryology, comparative biology, as well as the newly emerging fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Principles of Developmental Genetics highlights the intersection of developmental biology with new revolutionary genomic technologies, and details how these advances have accelerated our understanding of the molecular genetic processes that regulates development. This definitive resource provides researchers with the opportunity to gain important insights into the clinical applicability of emerging new technologies and animal model data. This book is a must-have for all researchers in genetics, developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and stem cell biology.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes new research not previously published in any other book on the molecular genetic\nprocesses that regulates development\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Chapters present a broad understanding on the application of animal model systems, allowing\nresearchers to better treat clinical disorders and comprehend human development\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Relates the application of new technologies to the manipulation of stem cells, causes of\nhuman birth defects, and several human disease conditions\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Each chapter includes a bulleted summary highlighting clinical aspects of animal models\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/8144/f171abe4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/8144/f171abe4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43285fef8c87c5f53b998144e2e4d7e1e8f68b90","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Developmental+Genetics%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtmrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43285fef8c87c5f53b998144e2e4d7e1e8f68b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,40,95,239,140,135,197,245,59,153,129,68,226,228,215,225,232,246,139,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

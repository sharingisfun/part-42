But now, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to face her biggest challenge since setting foot in the tiny bayou town. \n\nWhen mayoral candidate Ted Williams is murdered, everyone is surprised. Ted was a blowhole and a Yankee, but those usually werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t good reasons to kill someone. When Sinful Ladies Society leader Ida Belle becomes the lead suspect in the crime, Fortune knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to solve a murder and save one of the only friends sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever had. \n\nBut as the investigation begins, more and more secrets surface, and Fortune realizes that sometimes nothing is as it seems. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0a29c0581a6608d2a1fa091a714441474416d4","amp;dn":"Jana+DeLeon+-+Swamp+Sniper+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0a29c0581a6608d2a1fa091a714441474416d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,10,41,192,88,26,102,8,210,161,250,9,26,113,68,65,71,68,22,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Rating: \t\n  4.4 / 5 (based on 10 ratings). What did you think of it?\n\nOverview:\tA young boy (Jet Li) escaping from a slave camp is taken in by the monks of the Shaolin Temple. There, he learns martial arts in order to take revenge on the traitorous general who killed his father. His quest for vengeance implicates the monks, who come to his defense. In the process of fighting the general&amp;#039;s troops, they save the true emperor, who rewards them greatly.\n\nThis was Jet&amp;#039;s first big film, and the first of three Shao Lin pictures. All three feature incredible no-flying-people (i.e. the Kung Fu is real and performed without the use of wires). This film is from mainland China.\n\nCast: \tJet Li Lian-Jie  ||  Wong Chau-Yin  ||  Yu Hai  ||  Ding Lan  ||  Yu Hsing Wei \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab70754be489f54d09d34f6749409662d44546f9","amp;dn":"%5BKung+Fu%5D+The+Shaolin+Temple+%28Jet+Li+-+1982%29+-+DVD%2FRmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab70754be489f54d09d34f6749409662d44546f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,112,117,75,228,137,245,77,9,211,79,103,73,64,150,98,212,69,70,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A few centuries ago, the situation reversed and science became an intellectual endeavour in itself, quite like arts and humanities, and in turn generated a variety of applications and technologies (steam engine, electrical appliances, transistors, computers). The current situation is again a subtle role reversal, where demands and needs have led to new science (biotechnology, material science, and robotics). In an increasingly literate and technologically aware society, ideas in science need not be opaque even to the poet or the painter. The jargon and the equations, the instruments and implements are technical, but the basis is an idea that can be grasped by anyone. Popularization of science concerns just this-the capturing and interpreting of these ideas in science, and the bringing of &quot;town&quot; and &quot;gown&quot; together. This book on popular science is one such effort.\n\nAbout the Author\nApart from his professional activities as a biologist, Professor D Balasubramanian has been active in the popularization of science for two decades. Besides his fortnightly column in the national newspaper The Hindu, called &quot;Speaking of Science&quot;, he also participates in science programmes on television (UCC TV, Turning Point), radio and on the web. For these efforts, UNESCO, Paris, awarded him the Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science in 1997. He has earlier published Genes and Means, Cats have Nine Lives, and edited The Indian Human Heritage, and The Deccan Heritage.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 MOLECULAR MISTAKE AND DIABETES 1\n2 GENES THAT CONTROL FOOD PREFERNCE 4\n3 A DOCTOR'S DNA DILEMMA 8\n4 THE MOTHER OF ALL GENES 13\n5 GENE JOCKEYING COMES OF AGE 19\n6 HIGH SPEED KNOCKOUT IN THE BRAIN 24\n7 ADAM AND EVE WERE FROM AFRICA 30\n8 ALUS ARE RAREÃ¢â‚¬â€A GENETIC OXYMORON? 34\n9 ON THE ORIGINS OF INDIANS 39\n10 HEAVY WATER AND HEAVING CELLS 45\n11 THE LEVINTHAL PARADOX 49\n12 FULLER SPHERE OF GEODESIC MOLECULES 53\n13 NATURAL AND SUPRANATURAL MOLECULES 57\n14 WHAT CAUSES THE SCUM ON TEA? 61\n15 THERE IS A HOLE IN MY BUCKY AND THERE IS A BOAT IN MY BOTTLE 67\n16 BUT, DEEP BLUE, CAN YOU MAKE MUSIC? 72\n17 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATHÃ¢â‚¬â€PHENOMENON NON GRATA? 78\n18 WHY DOES THE STOMACH NOT DICEST ITSELF 82\n19 THE NEOLITHIC WHODUNIT AND HOWDUNIT 86\n20 TIPPLING RECEPTORS 91\n21 ON KUDUMI AND KERATIN 96\n22 FAT AS THE FIT FUEL 100\n23 ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL 105\n24 THE HORSE'S TOOTH AND THE MONGOL CONQUEST 110\n25 HOW OLD CAN A HUMAN BEING GET? 114\n26 THE SAHARAN ANT AND THE LIZARD - &quot;MADE FOR EACH OTHER&quot; 119\n27 OUT OF THE MOUTH OF SNAKES AND COWS 123\n28 WHY SAVE THE TIGER? 127\n29 SILKEN SNARE OF THE SPIDER 133\n30 PEPTIDES THAT PUNCTURE THE BODIES OF BUGS 138\n31 WHY IS THERE NO CAMEL GOD? 143\n32 THE BITTER TRUTH 148\n33 WHY SNAKES HAVE FORKED TONGUES 153\n34 OF SEAHORSES AND SEAS 157\n35 WAS THE DINOSAUR COLD-BLOODED OR WARM? 161\n36 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE CATERPILLAR KIND 166\n37 BACTERIOPHAGEÃ¢â‚¬â€LIVING ANTIBIOTICS 171\n38 WHAT SIZE SHOULD A BACTERIUM BE? 176\n39 TERMITE TALES AND GULLIVER'S TRAVAILS 182","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d72caa9a94b6c0e143da34e73dd08e9101c2d63","amp;dn":"The+Mother+of+All+Genes+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d72caa9a94b6c0e143da34e73dd08e9101c2d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,114,202,169,169,75,108,14,20,61,163,78,115,221,8,233,16,28,45,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

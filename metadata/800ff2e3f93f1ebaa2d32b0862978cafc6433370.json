It still holds up, though may have been surpassed by the even more brilliant &quot;Such and Such&quot; of just a few years back. This re-release contains in addition, however, the whole of the 20 minute+ -long instrumental &quot;Rhapsody&quot; from his instrumental album &quot;Swans at Coole,&quot; from circa 1988--a wonderful work in itself. So, the overall effect is to make a first rate collection half-again better. The original recording contained some of Tilston's best work, including 'These Days,' 'Here Comes the Night,' 'Polonaise,' and 'Sometimes in This Life,' and any of the rest of the material on it is better than anything one can find on most whole CDs. Don't miss this opportunity to sample one of the best singer-songwriter-guitarists out there (special note: Steve is one of folkdom's best fingerpicking guitarists--easily on a par with Richard Thompson or even Pierre Bensusan--and there is also this fact to highly recommend him). \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nPLEASE SEED\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/steve-tilston/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/steve-tilston/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800ff2e3f93f1ebaa2d32b0862978cafc6433370","amp;dn":"Steve+Tilston...Life+By+Misadventure%281987%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800ff2e3f93f1ebaa2d32b0862978cafc6433370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,15,242,227,249,63,30,186,162,211,43,8,98,151,140,175,198,67,51,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

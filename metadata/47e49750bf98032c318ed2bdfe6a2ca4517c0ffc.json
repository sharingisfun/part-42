Frankly, I think this show is dull, and I am surprised it got renewed for the next season. Anyway, I am dumping garbage off my hard drive, and I wanted to put this out there before I delete it forever.\n\nWhat makes this torrent worthy is that they made a joke that instantly ticked off the PC jerks, who demanded that the episode be edited, and never aired or released again with the joke intact. I hate PC jerks, and want this to remain available just to piss them off. The quote below from Wikipedia explains things:\n\nControversy\nOn November 14, 2007, FOX aired the episode of Back to You, &quot;Something&amp;#039;s Up There&quot;, which contained a controversial Polish slur. The slur involved Marsh trying to convince the show&amp;#039;s lone Polish-American character, Gary, to go bowling after work by saying: &quot;Come on, it&amp;#039;s in your blood, like kielbasa and collaborating with the Nazis.&quot;\nFOX later apologized on November 20, 2007. They vowed never to air the line of dialogue again in repeats and/or syndicated broadcasts. FOX stated that, &quot;The line was delivered by a character known for being ignorant, clueless, and for saying outlandish things. Allowing the line to remain in the show, however, demonstrated poor judgment, and we apologize to anyone who was offended.&quot;[32] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_You&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_You&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAgain, I do not really think the episode or the show is worth watching, but annoying the politically correct makes it worth the effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47e49750bf98032c318ed2bdfe6a2ca4517c0ffc","amp;dn":"Back+To+You+-+Banned+Episode+s01e07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47e49750bf98032c318ed2bdfe6a2ca4517c0ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,228,151,80,191,152,3,44,49,142,210,189,254,106,44,164,81,124,15,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

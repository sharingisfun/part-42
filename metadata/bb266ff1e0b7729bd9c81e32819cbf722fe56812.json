Now that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is an even more contested idea than ever, this volume informs the current discourse on European identity by analysing EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reaction to the tragedy, heroism and disgrace of the Second World War.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe question of how to define European identity remains fiercely contested in contemporary politics and scholarship.

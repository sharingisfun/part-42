When Andris' cousin helps him break out of prison he is more than pleased to join an expedition into unknown lands searching for mystical places and beings. But, like so much on this world, things do not work out as expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ee74ba12d16dc211dc2e292eb93c742cda15d5","amp;dn":"Brian+Stableford+-+Genesys+01+-+Serpent%27s+Blood.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ee74ba12d16dc211dc2e292eb93c742cda15d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,238,116,186,18,209,109,194,17,220,46,41,46,185,60,116,44,218,21,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

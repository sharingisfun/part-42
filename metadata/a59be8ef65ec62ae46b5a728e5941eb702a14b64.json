Some months later he finds out the lawman is on the bottle and a top gunfighter is heading his way to help Jason. Along with young Mississippi, handy with a knife and now armed with a diabolical shotgun, Cole returns to help. \n\nEditor Note: This uncut movie classic has a slight voice sync lapse in the last\nfew minutes, very watchable tho, imo....   \n\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer:  Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for fair-use purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

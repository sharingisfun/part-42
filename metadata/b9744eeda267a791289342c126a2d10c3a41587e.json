This programme pieces together the mistakes that led to the disaster. With a capacity of 3780 passengers and at an impressive 290m long and 31m high, the ship was a palace of the ocean. So how did this boat, hailed as a glorious example of modern technology, sink? And why do some critics say the design of these mega-cruisers is dangerous? These are just some of the questions this programme examines as it tries to understand how, after a century of safety measures and technological advances since the Titanic, a ship with so many passengers can sink. Using CGI and testimonial, it recreates a minute-by-minute account of the timeline to tragedy, featuring exclusive interviews with survivors, rescuers and world-renowned experts.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1990 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 47mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9744eeda267a791289342c126a2d10c3a41587e","amp;dn":"Ch4.Terror.At.Sea.The.Sinking.Of.The.Concordia.PDTV.x264.AC3..mk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9744eeda267a791289342c126a2d10c3a41587e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,116,78,237,162,103,167,145,40,147,66,193,38,162,209,12,58,65,88,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

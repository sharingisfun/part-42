It was the first single released by the band and was unsuccessful compared with later hits, reaching only number 126 in the United States. Despite this, it became a concert staple and remains one of the band's signature and most popular songs.\n\nTwenty-four years after its original US release, &quot;Break On Through&quot; became a minor hit in the UK, peaking at number 64 in the singles chart.\n\nThe song also appears as track one on the band's debut album. Elektra Records' censors objected to the drug use implied by the repeated line &quot;she gets high&quot;. The original album version and all reissues until the 1990s have the word &quot;high&quot; deleted, with Morrison singing &quot;she gets&quot; four times before a final wail. Live versions and more recent remastered releases have the full line restored. Regardless, classic rock radio stations and most compilations continue to use the censored version, as it is the version most familiar to listeners.\n\nThe Doors is the debut album by American rock band The Doors, recorded in August 1966 and released in January 1967. It was originally released in different stereo and mono mixes, and features the breakthrough single &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, extended with an instrumental section mostly omitted on the single release, and the lengthy song &quot;The End&quot; with its Oedipal spoken word section. The Doors credit the success of the album to being able to work the songs out night after night at the Whisky a Go Go and the London Fog. The Doors was ranked #42 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It has sold over 12.5 million copies.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_On_Through_(To_the_Other_Side)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_On_Through_(To_the_Other_Side)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nANcJAaep&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nANcJAaep&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:03\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

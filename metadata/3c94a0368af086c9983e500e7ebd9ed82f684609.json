ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s familiar while still feeling fresh, and each song feels better than the last. As a debut album, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even better. It shows promise, and when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over, the listener is eager to cash in on said promise. Luckily, after Dirty Radio has come to a close, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel as though Sallie Ford is one bit through with all sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had to say. There is a wealth of potential in this songwriter, and it seems as though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just getting started.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c94a0368af086c9983e500e7ebd9ed82f684609","amp;dn":"Sallie+Ford+%26amp%3B+The+Sound+Outside+-+Dirty+Radio+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c94a0368af086c9983e500e7ebd9ed82f684609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,148,160,54,138,240,134,201,152,62,80,14,126,189,158,216,47,104,70,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

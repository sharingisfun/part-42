Published in 2005, it was the author's first novel. Set in India, it tells the story of Ram Mohammad Thomas, a poor young waiter who becomes the biggest quiz-show winner in history, only to be sent to jail on accusations (but with no evidence or proof) that he cheated. It was the basis of the 2008 Oscar-winning feature film Slumdog Millionaire. The novel was re-published under the title Slumdog Millionaire after the success of the film.&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f91d86e3896457d5d42f8858c0eddc76623179d5","amp;dn":"Slumdog+Millionaire+%28+Q+%26+A%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f91d86e3896457d5d42f8858c0eddc76623179d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,29,134,227,137,100,87,213,212,47,136,88,192,237,220,118,98,49,121,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The focus is on the general principles of quantum mechanics and the clarification of its terminology: What exactly is a Hilbert space? What is a hermitean operator? A tensor product? An entangled state? In what sense does a wave function constitute a vector? A separate chapter discusses the many open questions regarding the interpretation of the postulates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:367dc9ae4b60504eeea9e06882ec881e058c0cbf","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Basis+of+Quantum+Mechanics+-+Jan-Markus+Schwindt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"367dc9ae4b60504eeea9e06882ec881e058c0cbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,125,201,174,75,96,80,78,238,169,224,104,130,236,136,30,5,140,12,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

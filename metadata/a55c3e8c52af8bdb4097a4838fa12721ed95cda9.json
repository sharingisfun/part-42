Shadow Man is coming. Going after evil from Liveside to Deadside. To stop the Apocalypse. To save your soul.\n\nShadow Man is a nonlinear third-person action/adventure game inspired by the Valiant Comics title of the same name. The game encompasses two enormous and varied worlds. Travel through Liveside, the land of the living, as mortal Mike LeRoi, and explore Deadside, the place where lost souls spend an eternity in torment, as his alter ego, the voodoo warrior Shadow Man. Take a ride into the unexplored territories of the human psyche as you try to stop a marauding band of villains from unleashing unspeakable horrors upon the world as we know it.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8, 1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended), 256 MB RAM (512 MB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c, DirectX9.0c- compatible sound card, mouse, keyboard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55c3e8c52af8bdb4097a4838fa12721ed95cda9","amp;dn":"Shadow+Man%2C+Italian+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55c3e8c52af8bdb4097a4838fa12721ed95cda9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,92,62,140,82,175,139,219,64,151,164,131,143,161,39,33,237,149,205,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

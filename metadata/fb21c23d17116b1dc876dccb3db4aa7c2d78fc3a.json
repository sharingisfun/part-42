With a first role as an infant in his mother Dorothy's arms and a childhood television debut in his father Lloyd's television series Sea Hunt, he burst onto the silver screen in The Last Picture Show in 1971 and was immediately recognized with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. He has created original and memorable characters in notable films since that time. To name but a few -- Heaven's Gate, Starman, Jagged Edge, The Fisher King, Fearless, Wild Bill, The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Big Lebowski, and his 2010 Oscar-winning best actor in Crazy Heart. He is an exceptional musician, an artist, a photographer, an occasional vintner and a story teller extraordinaire. He helped found the End Hunger Network in 1983 and continues to work with Share Our Strength, a foundation trying to eradicate childhood hunger.\r\nKnown for taking on-set still photographs of cast and crew during all of his recent movies, Bridges puts together an original album after wrapping and presents a copy to everyone. His photographs have been shown in galleries in Los Angeles, New York and London. He uses the Widelux camera, pioneered in France, and wrote about it in his 2003 volume Pictures. &quot;It is a fickle mistress ... it has arbitrariness to it, a capricious quality. I like that. It's something I aspire to in my work ... a willingness to receive what's there in the moment ... getting out of the way seems to be one of the main tasks for me as an artist.&quot;\r\n\r\nJeff Bridges: The Dude Abides is a production of THIRTEEN's American Masters for WNET.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f4/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Jeff-Bridges-The-Dude-Abides-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 771 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 6\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 21mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.80 GB\r\nSource: HDTV (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Jeff_Bridges:_The_Dude_Abides","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb21c23d17116b1dc876dccb3db4aa7c2d78fc3a","amp;dn":"PBS+American+Masters+Jeff+Bridges+The+Dude+Abides+720p+x264+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb21c23d17116b1dc876dccb3db4aa7c2d78fc3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,33,194,61,23,17,107,29,200,118,220,203,61,180,170,124,45,120,252,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

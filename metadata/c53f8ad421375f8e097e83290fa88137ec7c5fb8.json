TV Journalist Diana tapes evidence against drug lord Giancarlo, but on her way away from the scene, she is spotted and has to run. In the street, she runs into TV cook Jackie, whose knowledge of martial arts helps her survive the threat. Accidentally, her VHS-tape then gets mixed up with some kid's films in Jackie's car and so all the bad guys are after him as well as Diana, without him knowing where to find the right tape. But when Jackie's visiting girlfriend Miki gets kidnapped for the tape as ransom, Jackie puts the image of being the nice and friendly TV cook aside and goes to see Mr. Giancarlo himself to get her back: playtime's over.\n\nCast: Jackie Chan / Richard Norton / Miki Lee / Karen McLymont / Gabrielle Fitzpatrick / Vince Poletto / Barry Otto / Sammo Hung Kam-Bo / Emil Chau / Joyce Godenzi / Peter Houghton / Peter Lindsay / David No / Rachel Blakely / Judy Gree\n\n\ntrailer:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53f8ad421375f8e097e83290fa88137ec7c5fb8","amp;dn":"Mr.+Nice+Guy+Jackie+Chan+%281997%29+%5Bavrumi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53f8ad421375f8e097e83290fa88137ec7c5fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,63,138,212,33,55,95,142,9,126,131,41,15,168,129,55,236,124,95,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

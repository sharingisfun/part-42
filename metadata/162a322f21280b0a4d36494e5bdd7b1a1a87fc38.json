Sabres\n2. Stranded In Greenland\n3. Svengali\n4. They Said\n5. The Effect\n6. December\n7. The Last Laugh\n8. Paperwhites\n9. Clandestine High Holy\n\nNebraska's lone entry into the dream pop world, For Against initially consisted of bassist and vocalist Jeffrey Runnings, guitarist Harry Dingman, and drummer Greg Hill. Dingman and Hill left after 1988's December to form the Millions, and they were replaced by Steven &quot;Mave&quot; Hinrichs and Paul Engelhard after a replacement lineup failed to work out. (Dingman later returned for 2008's Shade Side Sunny Side.) \n\nSince its inception, Runnings' band has consistently produced a drifting yet distinctly rhythmic sound, soldiering through the myriad alternative scenes of the '80s and '90s. With one foot in the British post-punk of Joy Division and the other in the gliding atmospherics of Kitchens of Distinction, For Against are treasured by shamefully few; geography and infrequent touring have not helped.\n\nFor Against's stark and chilling second album is their best, one of the most powerful dream pop releases of the late '80s. Harry Dingman's icicle shots of chiming guitars, Greg Hill and Jeffrey Runnings' agile rhythmic thrust, and Runnings' boyish (but every bit as forceful) vocals rarely combine for a less-than-riveting listen. With its fluid bass-and-drum punch and enveloping twists of guitars, December's most fitting reference point is the Chameleons' Script of the Bridge. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162a322f21280b0a4d36494e5bdd7b1a1a87fc38","amp;dn":"For+Against+-+December+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162a322f21280b0a4d36494e5bdd7b1a1a87fc38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,42,50,47,33,40,11,10,77,54,73,78,91,221,123,26,26,135,252,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

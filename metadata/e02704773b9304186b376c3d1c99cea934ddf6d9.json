I know you have 20 minutes. No more worrying about finding time to go to the gym or what to eat in your hectic day. With my program youâ€™ll sweat, eat clean, and youâ€™ll be amazed at the results you can get in just 20 minutes a day. Thatâ€™s the same time it takes to check\n\r\n20 Minute Body is more than just workouts, itâ€™s mind over body and finding your Fitness From Within.\r\n\r\nH.I.I.T.\r\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training workouts are shorter, challenging, and unleash a host of fat burning hormonal changes from the inside out that allow you to cut your training time in half.\r\n\r\nZero to 60\r\nBy combining HIIT workouts with Functional Exercises and Cardio-Strength Training, your body can safely progress from zero to 60 without injury and less muscle soreness*â€”two of the main reasons why people quit training.\r\n\r\nTHE â€œAFTERBURNâ€\r\nThe more your push your body in short, timed intervals, the more energy or calories you burn to come back to a state of rest. The scientific principle behind this concept is called EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption), which creates an Afterburn effect where your metabolism is burning more calories for hours after a workout to return this state of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nGo Lean, Go Green, Go Clean\r\nProper nutrition that you actually enjoy and will cook, is more than half the challenge when getting in-shape. My program includes delicious 20-minute recipes and healthy nutrition tips that will help you go lean, green and clean.\r\n\r\nNo Gym Necessary\r\nWith either your own bodyweight or minimal equipment, you can do the workouts at home or on the roadâ€¦no gym, no excuses.\r\n\r\n5 moves To Fit\r\nEach workout has an average of 5 Big Bang exercises that use multiple muscles and burn the most amount of calories. These exercises are divided into Strength, Cardio or Core and I have also added a little Brazilian flare by adding some moves from the Brazilian martial art/dance Capoeira. The moves are easy to learn, fun and sequenced in a specific order to optimize fat loss!\r\n\r\nThe next 20 days is the Orange Program and itâ€™s all about progressionâ€“taking that fitness foundation from the Yellow Program and taking it up a notch with increased intensity and increased results. No more judgments. Itâ€™s time to step outside of your comfort zone on a daily basis and push harder, inside and out.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s Included\r\n\r\nProgram III\r\nThe Blue Program is about delivering the body that you want. With all the lessons youâ€™ve learned from the first two programs, you are going to take it through the roof! It is about â€œburn baby, burnâ€. Thereâ€™s no plateau and thereâ€™s no slowing down the results because they are going to keep improving.\r\nWhatâ€™s Included\r\n\r\nComplete Nutrition\r\nIncluded as a digital download with all 20 Minute Body Programs, my 20 Minute Body Nutrition Guide takes out the guess work and address nutrition challenges head-on with a comprehensive guide of fundamental concepts, meal plans, and a large and constantly growing catalogue of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack recipesâ€”all created in collaboration with professional chefs Jennifer Iserloh and Rocco Whalen.\r\n\r\nYour success rates will skyrocket with the phased approach that lets you ease into healthier eating habits over time, giving you the flexibility to change at your own pace.\r\n\r\nTraining Guide\r\nIncluded as a digital download with all my 20 Minute Body programs, get the most out of your training with my 20 Minute Body Training Guide.\r\n\r\nPlus These Bonuses!\r\n\r\nBonus #1\r\nCardio Capoeira.

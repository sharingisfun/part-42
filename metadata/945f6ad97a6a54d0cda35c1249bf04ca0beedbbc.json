Launch and recovery is the order of the day. During launch, powerful catapult gets you airborne in just a few hundred feet. And in recovery, your tailhook needs to catch the steel cable to bring your muscular aircraft to a screeching halt.\n\nThe new launch and recovery system is exclusive for Flight Deck 4 with easy to use catapult and cable. \n\nFrom the flight deck of the new USS Ronald Reagan, you&amp;#039;ll fly these seven aircraft: \n\nF/A-18C HornetTM \nF/A-18E Super HornetTM \nE-2C Hawkeye \nS-3B Viking \nSH-60 Seahawk \nC-2A Greyhound \nEA-6B Prowler \n  \n \n\napproach to recovery  \nPhoto of the F/A-18 Super Hornet\ncourtesy of US Navy  \nThe F/A-18 Super Hornet from\nFlight Deck 4 looks very similar  \nFlight Deck 4 uses an all-new simplified catapult launch and recovery system. You&amp;#039;ll experience the thrill of authentic deck operations with AI traffic on and above the carrier. You&amp;#039;ll see why cable recovery on the short flight deck is both thrilling and nerve-wracking.\n\nThis is our fourth iteration of our world-reknown Flight Deck series -bringing you the excitement of aircraft carrier-based flight.

You guys are fast. I just ordered FLIGHT DECK 3 yesterday and received it today. Thanks!&quot; \n \n \nLaunch\n\nHurry onto the deck. It&amp;#039;s launch time and you&amp;#039;re next in line.\n\nTaxi into position over the catapult. The launch team connects you.\n\nThe steam is flowing and now it&amp;#039;s armed.\n\nSet your brake. From his crouching position, the yellow jacketed shooter gives you thumbs up. \n\nIt&amp;#039;s game time. \n \nShove the throttles forward. Release the brakes. The catapult slams you to the back of your seat. \n\nBefore you know it, you&amp;#039;re hanging over the deck&amp;#039;s edge. \n \nGear and flaps up. Pull back hard. You&amp;#039;re up!\n\nYou can feel the sweat inside your helmet. Climb into the blue yonder.   \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nRecovery\n\nFlying over the sea, Mama is barely perceptible over the blue water. Drop down and you&amp;#039;ll see your home base. \n\nThe LSO orders you to lose altitude. Fly past and do a 180. \n\nFlaps down and throttle back.\n\nYour fingers tighten around the stick. You jiggle it back and forth as you line up with the swaying deck.\n\nDrop your gear and tailhook. Stay up there; don&amp;#039;t loose too much height. \n The LSO gives you the green. Hold steady. Over the edge hit the deck and give it full power.\n\n\n\nThe tailhook catches the cable . You&amp;#039;re jolted to a screeching stop.\n Your helmut bangs against the back of your seat. You&amp;#039;re down!\n\n\n\n\nThrottle back. The cable is down. Look down for the thumbs up. Taxi off. \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIFOLS &quot;Meatball&quot;\n\nHere&amp;#039;s a tool that you&amp;#039;ll use when landing. The center light on the meatball lets you know if you&amp;#039;re above or below the glideslope to the carrier. Click to see the IFOLS indicators, \n \nabove the glideslope \non the glideslope \nHeads Up Display\n\nYou can also use the HUD display to guide you onto the deck. On the left you can see that the aircraft icon is above the &quot;center&quot; mark meaning that you need to lose altitude to stay on the glideslope.\n   \nSpecial Effects\n\nSuperb workmanship and special effects add to the realism of Flight Deck 4.\n\nSee the steam venting from the deck surface at the catapult and the engine afterburners ready to get the aircraft airborne.\n   \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere&amp;#039;s a gallery of Flight Deck 4 aircraft and equipment.

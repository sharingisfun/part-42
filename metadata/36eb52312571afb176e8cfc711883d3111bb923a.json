The effort was produced by Lynch collaborator Chris &quot;the Wizard&quot; Collier.\n\nThe LYNCH MOB lineup on &quot;Rebel&quot; is comprised of Lynch, Oni Logan on vocals, Jeff Pilson (ex-DOKKEN, FOREIGNER, DIO) on bass and Brian Tichy (ex-WHITESNAKE, OZZY OSBOURNE) on drums.\n\nSongs like &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Dirty Money&quot; showcase Oni's trademark vocal ability while putting his diverse lyrical content on full display.\n\nThe song features an exciting opening riff and vocal melody and Lynch burns on one of his best guitar solos.\n\n\nTalking about &quot;Automatic Fix&quot;, Logan states: &quot;This is an interesting song in that it was the last song that was recorded vocally. I initially thoughtthat it might be best used as instrumental. I simply love this song because of its energy an attitude.&quot;\n\n\n\n&quot;Rebel&quot; track listing:\n\n01. Automatic Fix\n02. Between The Truth And A Lie\n03. Testify\n04. Sanctuary\n05. Pine Tree Avenue\n06. Jelly Roll\n07. Dirty Money\n08. The Hollow Queen\n09. The Ledge\n10. Kingdon Of Slaves\n11. War\n\n&quot;With 'Rebel', we allowed ourselves to move outside our normally imposed self restraints and tread some forbidden sonic territories,&quot; explains Lynch. &quot;What surprises me is no matter how far we attempt to stray away from the classic 'LYNCH MOB formula,' we can never really escape the chemistry between myself and Oni. There's just a thing that happens there that's unique to us and undeniable.&quot;\n\nLYNCH MOB formed in 1989 after Lynch exited DOKKEN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36eb52312571afb176e8cfc711883d3111bb923a","amp;dn":"Lynch+Mob+-+Rebel++2015++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36eb52312571afb176e8cfc711883d3111bb923a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,235,82,49,37,113,175,177,118,232,207,199,17,136,61,49,17,187,146,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's often that everyone does similar work and it is our job to strive to make something outside the curve. \n\nBy the end of this tutorial you should have some new ideas on how to create your own hand painted textures efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nTutor for this course: Lee Magalhaes, guest tutor\nLee MagalhÃƒÂ£es graduated from the Istituto Europeu di Design (IED) in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo with a bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree in Digital &amp; Virtual Design.

Now that the galaxy has been saved again, the crew begin to see each other in a new light.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the Veracityâ€™s wake lie a string of crimes â€“ and someone has got to pay. Former assassin Raena Zacari is hauled back to the weapons-free pleasure planet Kai to answer charges of kidnapping, murder, and the theft of an Imperial-era diplomatic transport: the Veracity itself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, something is moving in the undersea city Raena destroyed on the Thallian homeworld. Has the worst mass-murderer the galaxy has ever known been cloned back from the dead? Can the Veracityâ€™s crew lay the ghosts to rest without Raenaâ€™s lethal skills?\r\n\r\nNo More Heroes mixes courtroom science fiction with sweeping space opera that features aliens, androids, drug dealers, journalists, and free-running media hackers. Following The Dangerous Type and Kill By Numbers, No More Heroes is the final book in Loren Rhoadsâ€™s epic trilogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c4a952960091887e7f5e67988758aa03e454e2","amp;dn":"Loren+Rhoads+-+No+More+Heroes+%28In+the+Wake+of+the+Templars+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c4a952960091887e7f5e67988758aa03e454e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,196,169,82,150,0,145,136,126,127,94,103,152,135,88,170,3,228,84,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

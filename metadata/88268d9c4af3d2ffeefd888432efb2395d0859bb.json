RCA did release a CD version but they seriously over filtered and didn\\&amp;#039;t include all of the vinyl material.\n\nThe Irish ballads are especially haunting, as is the Old House written by a retiring general.  The Moore songs are beautiful and soulful.  I wish Christy Moore would record some of these before he dies.\n\n\nTitle 1 = Garden Where The Praties Grow\n\nTitle 2 = The Harp That Once Through Tara\\&amp;#039;s Halls\n\nTitle 3 = Terence\\&amp;#039;s Farewell To Kathleen\n\nTitle 4 = Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms\n\nTitle 5 = Green Isle Of Erin\n\nTitle 6 = Kerry Dance\n\nTitle 7 = O Mary Dear (Londonderry Air)\n\nTitle 8 = Star of the County Down\n\nTitle 9 = Oft in the Stilly Night\n\nTitle 10 = She is Far From the Land\n\nTitle 11 = Meeting Of The Waters\n\nTitle 12 = Bard Of Armagh\n\nTitle 13 = Down by the Sally Gardens\n\nTitle 14 = She Moved Thro\\&amp;#039; the Fair\n\nTitle 15 = Green Bushes\n\nTitle 16 = Off To Philadelpia\n\nTitle 17 = Bantry Bay\n\nTitle 18 = Bless This House\n\nTitle 19 = I\\&amp;#039;ll Walk Beside You\n\nTitle 20 = Drink To Me Only\n\nTitle 21 = I Know of Two Bright Eyes\n\nTitle 22 = Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\n\nTitle 23 = Lovliest Of Trees\n\nTitle 24 = Linden Lea\n\nTitle 25 = Passing By\n\nTitle 26 = Song To The Seals\n\nTitle 27 = Silent Night\n\nTitle 28 = So Deep is the Night\n\nTitle 29 = O Could I But Express in Song\n\nTitle 30 = When You Wish Upon a Star\n\nTitle 31 = Little Wooden Head\n\nTitle 32 = Little Silver Ring\n\nTitle 33 = Silent Noon\n\nTitle 34 = Cloths Of Heaven\n\nTitle 35 = The Old House\n\n\nIf you download, then SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88268d9c4af3d2ffeefd888432efb2395d0859bb","amp;dn":"John+McCormack+-+Popular+Song+%26+Irish+Ballads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88268d9c4af3d2ffeefd888432efb2395d0859bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,38,141,156,74,243,210,255,238,253,136,132,50,239,178,57,93,8,89,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

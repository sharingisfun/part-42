Previous editions have been praised for providing complete and precise statements of theorems, using geometric reasoning in applied problems, and for offering a range of applications across the sciences. Written in a clear, coherent, and readable form, Calculus: Single Variable makes student comprehension a clear priority.\n\n \n\nThis seventh edition features a new co-author, Dr. Christopher Essex, who has been invited to contribute his unique style and approach to the subject material. Instructors and students will appreciate revised exercises, greater emphasis on differential equations, new pedagogical features, and an enhanced MyLab.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublisher:  Prentice Hall Canada\nCopyright:  2010\nFormat:  Paper; 688 pp\nPublished:  28 Aug 2009\n\n\nISBN-10: 0321549279\nISBN-13:  9780321549273","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ada04a79a1aafad03bd0e665b547a326d687b8f","amp;dn":"Calculus%3A+Single+Variable%2C+7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ada04a79a1aafad03bd0e665b547a326d687b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,218,4,167,154,26,175,173,3,189,14,102,91,84,122,50,109,104,123,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Covering all known species (around 460), this guide will enable identification of all land mammals likely to be seen anywhere in Africa. Detailed accounts, with colour illustrations, are provided for most species, but some complex small mammal groups are summarized by genera. The colour illustrations show both sexes in sexually dimorphic species, and there are also a wealth of line drawings illustrating typical behaviours, the function of camouflaged or disruptive markings and the details of interspecific variation among closely allied species. Distribution maps show the ranges of most species covered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e6ccf407ca32b76947415af4c0f2035b0512e8","amp;dn":"The+Kingdon+Field+Guide+to+African+Mammals+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e6ccf407ca32b76947415af4c0f2035b0512e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,230,204,244,7,202,50,183,105,71,65,90,244,192,242,3,91,5,18,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

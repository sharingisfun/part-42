People came from around the globe to attend the services, and many outlandish claims were made as to the results. But for all the hype, the ?Brownsville Revival? was just another typical Charismatic sideshow.\n\nIn this volume, Dr. Ruckman examines the methods and doctrines of modern Charismatic revivals using the Brownsville Revival as a model. This material is not heresay but a minute examination of the ?outpouring? based on the writings of the men who conducted the meetings and on the eyewitness accounts of their choice friends who witnessed dozens of services.\nThis study is absolutely essential to the Christian living in these ?Latter Days? of the Great Apostasy.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy scriptures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403a1e7bb912f2d84d142b8a34b23fd6507491e7","amp;dn":"Modern+Charismatic+Revival+Doctrines+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403a1e7bb912f2d84d142b8a34b23fd6507491e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,58,30,123,185,18,242,216,77,20,43,138,52,178,63,214,80,116,145,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

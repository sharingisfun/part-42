Its plot enlarges on Alexander Pushkin's work 'Mozart and Salieri' itself based on rumours recorded in Beethoven's conversation books &amp; current in Vienna at Salieri's death. But this was just the vehicle. Shaffer's great achievement was to conjure up Vienna &amp; Mozart, and to make Mozart's art seem fresh minted.\n\nThis is the National Theatre's production. The Criterion Theatre's production used a slightly different version of the text.\n\n\n\nCast\nPaul Scofield\nSimon Callow\nFelicity Kendal\nDonald Gee\nSusan Gilmore\nJohn Normington\nWilliam Sleigh\nWilloughby Goddard\nBasil Henson\nNicholas Selby\nPeggy Marshall\nGlenn Williams\nRobin Meredith\nNigel Bellairs\nAnne Sedgwick\nDermont Crawley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4d6dbc96e0d5a7e935777705ce4c72e7522415","amp;dn":"Peter+Shaffer+-++Amadeus++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4d6dbc96e0d5a7e935777705ce4c72e7522415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,77,109,188,150,224,213,167,233,53,119,119,5,206,76,114,231,82,36,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

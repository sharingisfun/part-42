Although our knowledge about the build-up of the human body has multiplied, in many books on the subject of Martial Arts an explanation concerning the effect of various striking and pressure techniques has reduced to mentioning merely causes pain, paralyzes, death . Explanations are missing or are left in the realm of the esoteric. However it would be appreciated very much, if not simply from a standpoint of personal responsibility, if the followers of Martial Arts delved more into the possible medical outcome of their actions.\r\n\r\n(The EPUB version has modified anatomical diagrams, because of image resolution issues during the conversion, that made them hard to read. The original images can be found in the PDF)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff8521ea8db15412f8a0b40a169280c3a5c8dcf","amp;dn":"The+Secrets+of+Kyusho+-+Pressure+Point+Fighting+-+EPUB+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff8521ea8db15412f8a0b40a169280c3a5c8dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,248,82,30,168,219,21,65,47,138,11,64,161,105,40,12,58,92,141,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

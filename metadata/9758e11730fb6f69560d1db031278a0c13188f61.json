The great trumpeter/vocalist performs a dozen songs, all of which have &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;angel&quot; in their title or lyrics, while backed by the Sy Oliver Orchestra plus a heavenly female choir. Satch gets off a few good trumpet solos and is quite cheerful throughout, even joking during &quot;The Prisoner's Song&quot; when the word &quot;angel&quot; finally shows up. Among the highlights are &quot;When Did You Leave Heaven,&quot; &quot;I Married An Angel&quot; and &quot;I'll String Along With You.&quot; Although more commercial than Armstrong's usual recordings of the era, this set is more memorable than one would expect and is worth searching for. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - When Did You Leave Heaven\n02 - You're A Heavenly Thing\n03 - I Married An Angel\n04 - A Sinner Kissed An Angel\n05 - Angela Mia\n06 - Angel Child\n07 - And The Angels Sing\n08 - Fools Rush In\n09 - I'll String Along With You\n10 - Angel\n11 - The Prisoner's Song\n12 - Good Night, Angel\n\nEnjoy and share!

Deibert grabbed whatever was readily available for a costume, a mixtape and a keyboard and went onstage. The project soon evolved into a part-time two-member band, with Deibert (as &quot;Mann: Realiser of Music&quot;) performing on keyboards, synthesizers and drum machines while a friend in a horse costume (stage name &quot;Hoerse: Creator of the Dance&quot;) provided dancing accompaniment. The band released only one album, 2001's Theirs Travel Began and Loaded the Dream on Horchata Records, before entering a quasi-hiatus, reducing their concerts to at least once a year.\n\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Deibert\n\n-------------\n\n1.

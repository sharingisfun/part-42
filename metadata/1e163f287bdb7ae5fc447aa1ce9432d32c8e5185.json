Experience indicates a need for MEMS book covering these materials as well as the most important process steps in bulk micro-machining and modeling. We are very pleased to present this book that contains 18 chapters, written by the experts in the field of MEMS.\n\nTitle: Microelectromechanical Systems and Devices\nAuthor: Nazmul Islam\nPublisher: InTech\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!

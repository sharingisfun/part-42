Then heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shanghaied by black-suited goons and flown to Mount Meru, a vast complex built atop an island in the Maldives. There, Zak meets a trio of billionaire businessmen who put him to work designing costumes for a team of godlike super-powered beings based on the ten avatars of Vishnu from Hindu mythology. \nThe Ten Avatars battle demons and aliens and seem to be the saviours of a world teetering on collapse. But their presence is itself a harbinger of apocalypse. The Vedic Ã¢â‚¬Å“fourth ageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of civilisation, Kali Yuga, is coming to an end, and Zak has a ringside seat for the final, all-out war that threatens the destruction of Earth.\n\n\nAuthors:\tLovegrove, James\nSeries:\tBook VII of The Pantheon Series\nFormats:\tEPUB, MOBI, PDF\nTags:\tScience Fiction\nPublisher:  Solaris (March 25, 2014)\nPrint Length:   448 pages \nLanguage:   English\nASIN:   B00J7WZONU\nISBN-10:   1781081816\nISBN-13:   978-1781081815\n\n\nHello all!

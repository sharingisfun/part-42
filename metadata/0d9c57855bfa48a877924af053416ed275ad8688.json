Each CD he&amp;#039;s released has had a unique blend of ballads, outlaw, honkeytonk, thought-provoking, and just downright fun, music. Each CD gets better and better. He&amp;#039;s very possibly the best kept secret in country music - and while he&amp;#039;s successful, he&amp;#039;s not beholden to the powers of the industry to change like other artists have been.\n\nInformaciÃƒÂ³n Disco:\n?

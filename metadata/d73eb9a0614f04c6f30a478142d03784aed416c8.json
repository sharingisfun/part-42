When Taylor calls to say she won't be attending, Kim and Kyle are shocked -- not just because Taylor is jetting off with a new love, but because she doesn't know where her daughter is. Later, Adrienne gets angry with Paul because he won't evacuate their home when Lisa's old house is in flames across the street. They make up in time for Kyle's white party, however, and are a united front when everyone confronts them about their threatened lawsuit against Brandi.\n\n\nNote: The aspect ratio has been fixed, all thanks to RKSTR. \n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73eb9a0614f04c6f30a478142d03784aed416c8","amp;dn":"The.Real.Housewives.Of.Beverly.Hills.S03E14.PROPER.HDTV.x264-RKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73eb9a0614f04c6f30a478142d03784aed416c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,62,185,160,97,79,4,198,243,10,71,129,66,208,55,132,174,212,22,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

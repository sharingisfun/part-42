Bebop, cool, and fusion all have Davis' handprints deep in the cement of their foundations, and this disc documents some of his best work during the second of those periods. \r\n\r\nIn the mid-'50s he started what would be a tumultuous musical relationship with John Coltrane, and what would eventually become one of the greatest combos in jazz history began to coalesce: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones in addition to Davis and Coltrane.\r\n\r\nThe tracks on this CD were selected from four live-in-the-studio recordings made by Davis' combo shortly after the sessions for the Milestones LP were completed, and it features burning renditions of such period favorites as &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; (featuring some unfortunately inaudible piano by Bill Evans), &quot;Bag's Groove&quot; (featuring some strangely incongruous Latin percussion), and Thelonious Monk's &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot; (in a particularly blistering, hard-charging version). Coltrane is fresh from having kicked his heroin habit and is in especially sharp form here â€“ these sessions are a major find.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.

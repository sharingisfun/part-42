But after arriving in the body of a willing human sacrifice instead of a Mayan king, JedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences led him to the fateful decision that rather than avert the apocalypse, he must ensure instead that the world ends.\n\nUsing his knowledge of the divination game, Jed sets in motion a series of events that will bring about the destruction of humanity, ending the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pain and suffering once and for all. But before the plan can be completed, the organization that sent him into the past discovers his intention and devotes every resource to stop him.\n\nTaking readers back to the dizzying action of ancient times, The Sacrifice Game is a breathtaking odyssey in which Jed must survive bloody wars, ruthless leaders, shifting alliances, and unspeakable betrayal to learn about the Game, before his time in both the ancient Mayan empire and the present day runs out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071d128a036cdce323ceb924579faeb32679f1c7","amp;dn":"Jed+de+Landa+Books+I+%26amp%3B+II+by+Brian+D%27Amato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071d128a036cdce323ceb924579faeb32679f1c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,29,18,138,3,108,220,227,35,206,185,36,87,159,174,179,38,121,241,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In places, there is also some rather humorous creature interactions with the camera.  This show was very well done!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f09c7318d14d66b8f41e0e0e45bbb2637697c5","amp;dn":"Walking.with.Monsters-Life.Before.the.Dinosaurs%5B2005%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f09c7318d14d66b8f41e0e0e45bbb2637697c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,240,156,115,24,209,77,102,184,244,30,14,14,69,187,178,99,118,151,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

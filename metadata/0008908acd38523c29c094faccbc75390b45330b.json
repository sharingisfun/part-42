I want to share them with you. Moreover, all of the (except Lego) are ported from Pocket PCs, so they can run even on weak computers (like slower Pentiums e.g. Pentium 120). Good for killing some free time in your office :-) Only PC versions are freeware - if you want them for Pocket PCs you would have to pay quite hefty bills.\n\nThe games are:\n- Lego Digital Designer \n- Resco PC Pack (Sudoku, Sokoban, Diamonds, Defender)\n- PDAmill GameBox Asia (Mahjongg, Shisen-sho, Nagori)\n- PDAmill GameBox Solitaire - a collection of solitaires (card games)\n- PDAmill Arvale - an RPG\n- PDAmill Flux - a 3D racing game (winner of the Pocket PC Awards Best Simulation Game of 2006)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0008908acd38523c29c094faccbc75390b45330b","amp;dn":"Lego%2C+Resco+%26+PDAmill+Game+Pack++%5BMini+Games%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0008908acd38523c29c094faccbc75390b45330b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,8,144,138,205,56,82,60,41,192,148,250,204,188,117,57,11,69,51,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Filmed in high definition, the pace, polish, gorgeous Elizabethan costumes and the rollicking performances dazzled the audience.\n\nMy notes\n\n   After having seen other versions of Merry Wives Of Windsor I included it in my collection of Globe On Screen for completeness.  But this performance won me over totally and I have enjoyed the number of times I have watched it in total while working on the audio (see paragraph below.)  The story about Merry Wives is that the Queen requested aaplay about Falstaff in love.  Here I have to give immense credit to the whole ensemble cast.  I do not want to give away who gets the biggest cheer at the conclusion of performance,  You will see that for yourself. \n\n\nThis is my encode with enhanced audio for personal viewing.  It involved balancing the audio so that all voices on stage from different microphones come through at equal volume.  My thanks to videohelp.com for giving the technique and the free software program Levelator 2 which performs the audio balancing.  Levelator is free but no longer in development.\n\nNotes written October 11, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac56d3145bfe3f89edd35c22890413d873f4f356","amp;dn":"Shakespeares+Globe+On+Screen+Merry+Wives+Of+Windsor+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac56d3145bfe3f89edd35c22890413d873f4f356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,86,211,20,91,254,63,137,237,211,92,34,137,4,19,216,115,244,243,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

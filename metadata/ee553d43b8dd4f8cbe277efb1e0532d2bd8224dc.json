It offers exceptional, straight-forward writing, complemented with useful pedagogical tools.\nPhysical Science introduces basic concepts and key ideas while providing opportunities for students to learn reasoning skills and a new way of thinking about their environment. No prior work in science is assumed. The text offers students complete coverage of the physical sciences with a level of explanation and detail appropriate for all students.\nThe sequence of chapters in Physical Science is flexible, and the instructor can determine topic sequence and depth of coverage as needed. The materials are also designed to support a conceptual approach, or a combined conceptual and problem-solving approach. Along with the accompanying laboratory manual, the text contains enough material for the instructor to select a sequence for a two-semester course.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nPreface x\n1 What Is Science? 1\nPHYSICS\n2 Motion 25\n3 Energy 61\n4 Heat and Temperature 85\n5 Wave Motions and Sound 115\n6 Electricity 139\n7 Light 177\nCHEMISTRY\n8 Atoms and Periodic Properties 205\n9 Chemical Bonds 231\n10 Chemical Reactions 253\n11 Water and Solutions 277\n12 Organic Chemistry 301\n13 Nuclear Reactions 325\nASTRONOMY\n14 The Universe 353\n15 The Solar System 378\n16 Earth in Space 407\nEARTH SCIENCE\n17 Rocks and Minerals 435\n18 Plate Tectonics 457\n19 Building EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Surface 479\n20 Shaping EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Surface 503\n21 Geologic Time 523\n22 The Atmosphere of Earth 543\n23 Weather and Climate 567\n24 EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Waters 599\nAppendices A-E\nCredits C1\nIndex I1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee553d43b8dd4f8cbe277efb1e0532d2bd8224dc","amp;dn":"Physical+Science+%2810th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee553d43b8dd4f8cbe277efb1e0532d2bd8224dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,85,61,67,184,221,79,140,190,39,126,251,30,5,50,210,189,130,36,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

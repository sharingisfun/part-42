The volume presents 19 carefully revised full papers selected from 32 submissions during a thorough reviewing process. The papers cover work related to all aspects of theorem proving in higher order logics, particularly based on secure mechanization of those logics; the theorem proving systems addressed include Coq, HOL, Isabelle, LEGO, and PVS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4ea7484601092d1bc60ac24861f4942cf0e4d1","amp;dn":"Theorem+Proving+in+Higher+Order+Logics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4ea7484601092d1bc60ac24861f4942cf0e4d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,78,167,72,70,1,9,45,27,198,10,194,72,97,244,148,44,240,228,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

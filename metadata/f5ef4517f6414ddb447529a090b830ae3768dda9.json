Could it be John Scogin, Edward IV's jester, whose favourite skit was to burn people alive? Or could it be Andrew Boarde, physician to Henry VIII, who wrote John Scogin's biography? Or could it be a Kurd called Gaffar whose days are blighted by an unspeakable terror of salad? Or a beautiful bulimic with brittle bones? Or a man who guards Beckley Woods with a Samurai sword and a pregnant terrier?\n\nDarkmans is a very modern book, set in ridiculously modern Ashford in Kent, England, about two old-fashioned subjects: love and jealousy. And the main character? The past, creeping up on the present and whispering something quite dark into its ear.\n\nDarkmans is the third of Nicola Barker's visionary Thames Gateway novels. Following Wide Open (winner Dublin IMPAC award 2000) and Behindlings it confirms one of Britain's most original literary talents.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ef4517f6414ddb447529a090b830ae3768dda9","amp;dn":"Darkmans+-+Nicola+Barker++%282007+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ef4517f6414ddb447529a090b830ae3768dda9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,239,69,23,246,65,77,219,68,117,41,160,144,184,48,174,55,104,221,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When the government asks both men to take a break from being famous to get back to fighting, Falcon and Buffalo Bill head west-into a hornet's nest of trouble.\n\nA renegade Indian has followed his vision of bloodshed on a once peaceable territory. A land baron uses the slaughter as an excuse to clear out a valley. And the U.S. Army, trying to keep the peace, is backstabbed by a traitor. Now, Falcon and Cody are headed into this beautiful, vast and deadly land. A place where history, spirits, greed, and guns have come together-and hot lead is roaring like a prairie fire . . .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6dff18f4b5ba28028d0fcabb8789f663901f6bc","amp;dn":"William+W.+Johnstone-+Massacre+of+Eagles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6dff18f4b5ba28028d0fcabb8789f663901f6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,223,241,143,75,91,162,128,40,208,252,171,184,120,159,102,57,1,246,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

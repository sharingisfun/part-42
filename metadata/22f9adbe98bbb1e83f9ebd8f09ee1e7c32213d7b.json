It was the first and last period before the Romans in which great political and military power was located in the same place as cultural importance. This volume therefore is more narrowly focused geographically than its predecessors and successors, and hardly strays beyond Greece. Athens is at the centre of the picture, both politically and culturally, but events and achievements elsewhere are assessed as carefully as the nature of our sources allows. Two series of narrative chapters, one on the growth of the Athenian empire and the development of Athenian democracy, the other on the Peloponnesian War which brought them down, are divided by a series of studies in which the artistic and literary achievements of the fifth century are described. This new edition has been completely replanned and rewritten in order to reflect the advances in scholarship and changes in perspective which have been taking place in the sixty years since the publication of its predecessor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f9adbe98bbb1e83f9ebd8f09ee1e7c32213d7b","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Ancient+History+Vol+05+-+The+Fifth+Century+B.C.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f9adbe98bbb1e83f9ebd8f09ee1e7c32213d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,249,173,190,152,187,177,232,63,158,189,143,9,238,30,124,50,33,61,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

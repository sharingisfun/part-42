Their beginnings can be traced back to the late 1960s. The band played an important role in the development of speed[1] and thrash metal,[2] being part of the German heavy metal scene, which emerged in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nFollowing their disbandment in 1997 and short-lived reunion in 2005, Accept reunited again in 2009 with former T.T. Quick frontman Mark Tornillo[3] replacing Dirkschneider and released their two highest charting albums to date, Blood of the Nations and Stalingrad.[4] They have sold over 17 million albums worldwide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a377ae163d0830d546794d6a7be7223235d882","amp;dn":"accept+%28ger%29+complete+discography-japan+editions-demos-live-comp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a377ae163d0830d546794d6a7be7223235d882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,163,119,174,22,61,8,48,213,70,121,77,106,123,231,34,50,53,216,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

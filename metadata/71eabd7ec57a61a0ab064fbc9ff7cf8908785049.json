All the actors wear animal masks, and their voices are dubbed. There are a few scenes involving clay animation.\n\nThe tagline used in the US release was, &quot;A bizarre tale of sex, lust, and the French Revolution.&quot;\n\n\nIn pre-revolutionary France, the canine Marquis de Sade sits in jail working on his writing and having conversations with his penis which has a face and is named Colin. When Colin is not whining about his need for stimulation and espousing his impulsive philosophies, he is &quot;telling stories&quot; that make up the Marquis' work (some of which is illustrated via clay animation).\n\nThe Marquis was imprisoned for allegedly defecating on a cross, however he is also accused of raping and impregnating the bovine Justine. The latter is a plot by the camel-headed priest Don Pompero and the cocky Gaetan De Preaubois try to keep secret the fact that Justine's rapist was actually the King of France.\n\nMeanwhile, the revolutionaries prepare to stage a coup and depose the king. Several of the inmates are also political prisoners leading to several failed escape attempts which land the inmates in the Bastille dungeon. They are eventually freed, however, by the revolutionaries.\n\nCollin runs away with one of the revolutionaries leaving the Marquise to continue his writing and to muse about his life in peace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71eabd7ec57a61a0ab064fbc9ff7cf8908785049","amp;dn":"Marquis+%281989%29+-+%5C%27A+bizarre+tale+of+sex%2C+lust%2C+and+the+French+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71eabd7ec57a61a0ab064fbc9ff7cf8908785049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,234,189,126,197,122,97,160,171,6,79,188,159,247,207,137,8,120,80,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

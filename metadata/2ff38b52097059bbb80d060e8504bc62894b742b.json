Every few years someone will pop their ugly head out of the woodwork and try to release an album that reignites the core sound of old school Metal.  Whether it's an old face trying to remind the world that he still exists and lost all of his money either up his nose or into his lungs a long time ago or a fresh new band that desperately want to sound like their heroes of old but are too afraid to stick anything anywhere so they just straddle a very bland red line of mediocrity instead, you can rest assure that like the changing of the seasons they will come around.\n1.

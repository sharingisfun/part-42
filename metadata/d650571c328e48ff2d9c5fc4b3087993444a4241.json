For the first time ever, there will now be recorded proof.  The Twilight Singers will release their first ever live album Live In New York on November 15th. \n\n\nRecorded at Webster Hall in New York City this past May, the show was easily one of the highlights from the band's world tour in support of their latest release Dynamite Steps.  Live In New York features 21 songs from the band's entire career including: &quot;Teenage Wristband,&quot; &quot;I'm Ready,&quot; &quot;Annie Mae,&quot; &quot;On The Corner&quot; and many others.  \n\n\nReviews:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16083-the-twilight-singers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16083-the-twilight-singers/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.examiner.com/indie-rock-in-chicago/album-review-the-twilight-singers-live-new-york-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.examiner.com/indie-rock-in-chicago/album-review-the-twilight-singers-live-new-york-review&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.snobsmusic.net/2011/11/twilight-singers-live-in-new-york-mini.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.snobsmusic.net/2011/11/twilight-singers-live-in-new-york-mini.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHat tip to plixid.com for this, and as always support these indies if you enjoy their music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d650571c328e48ff2d9c5fc4b3087993444a4241","amp;dn":"Twilight+Singers+-+Live+in+New+York+-+2011+-+192+kbps+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d650571c328e48ff2d9c5fc4b3087993444a4241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,80,87,28,50,142,72,255,45,156,95,196,179,8,121,147,68,74,66,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

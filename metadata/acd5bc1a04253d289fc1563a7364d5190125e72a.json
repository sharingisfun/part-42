It automatically integrates with iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, Photobooth, Adobe Lightroom 2 and more. You can share all content from these applications or choose specific playlists and albums.\n\nPlayback can also share media stored in folders or even make entire disks available to your Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. By default, Playback will share almost any content on your system. No configuration required!\n\nIf you prefer to tinker, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll appreciate PlaybackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built-in access control list (ACL) and bandwidth throttling. The ACL allows you to control which devices have access to your media. Bandwidth throttling limits the transfer rate from your computer to your UPnP device so others on your network can still surf the web and check their email.\n\nThis is the same technology that powers YouTube, Wikipedia, and many other popular sites.\n\nOther features include Growl notifications, on-screen thumbnails powered by QuickLook, and much more!\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nVersion 1.7:\nNew: Playback now serves media using nginx rather than lighttpd.\nNew: Brand-new streaming engine for unparalleled performance.\nNew: Status menu now includes a &quot;Check For Updates...&quot; item.\nFixed: High CPU usage when streaming MP4 files to the PS3.\nFixed: Issues with names containing special characters.\nUpdated: French &amp; Italian localizations.\nOther: Various fixes and tweaks.\n\nsource: http://www.yazsoft.com/products/playback/\n\n\n*I found this on Demonoid and I thought it would be nice to bring it over to the Bay!!*\n\nENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd5bc1a04253d289fc1563a7364d5190125e72a","amp;dn":"Playback+1.7+%5BK%5C%27ed%5D+-+NEW+and+FASTER+ENGINE+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd5bc1a04253d289fc1563a7364d5190125e72a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,213,188,26,4,37,61,40,159,193,86,58,115,100,213,25,1,37,231,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

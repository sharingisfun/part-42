The books concentrate on either biography or aesthetics. Seldom has anyone described those details that are part of the creation of the work of art itself. One reason is that the studios of great painters are seldom preserved intact after their deaths. Even if some are preserved, or made into museums, the &quot;cleaning-up&quot; usually destroys the link with the artists. However, with most studios I was fortunate; Cezanne's, for instance, was still more or less as he had left it. I looked at the studios with the painter's interest in mind. Whenever I saw a significant detail that added to my fuller knowledge of the artist and his method of work I recorded it. To document the creative act I had to observe it without altering it by my presence. To gain the confidence of an artist, so that he could work as if I were not in the studio, took several years of patient visits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050c4f082ac5c416a427b7c0b6ec901e0fe5f5a2","amp;dn":"The+artist+in+his+studio+%28Art+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050c4f082ac5c416a427b7c0b6ec901e0fe5f5a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,12,79,8,42,197,196,22,164,39,183,192,182,236,144,30,15,229,245,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

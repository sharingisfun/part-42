They aren't always kind. Violet Eden is certain of all this because she is Grigori - part angel, part human. She has felt the influence of both light and dark. Since her seventeenth birthday, Violet has known she is a warrior. Though she is more powerful than she yet realises, two men could still sway her away from her path if she lets them. Violet's uncertainty about Phoenix continually shakes her soul and her love for Lincoln is perhaps her greatest weakness. When Hell unleashes its worst, Violet must embrace every facet of her angel self to save the people she cares about and the world as she knows it. But death is not the worst thing that Violet will face. For her, the endless question 'Can love conquer all?' will finally be answered.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a92f450cd9e7588ef95151baff239692d492b5","amp;dn":"Endless+-+Jessica+Shirvington.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a92f450cd9e7588ef95151baff239692d492b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,169,47,69,12,217,231,88,142,249,81,81,186,255,35,150,146,212,146,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

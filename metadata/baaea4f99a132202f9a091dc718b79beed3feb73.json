And they are BlazinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in the past decade no other band has quite captured Scottish fiddle musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s variety, energy and sensitivity like BlazinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Fiddles have. Like rare single malts, each member of BlazinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Fiddles draws the distinct flavour of music from their part of the Highlands and Islands. Blending solo and ensemble sets, aged with the occasional insightful tale, they all come together in a fiery blend to excite your senses. From remote village halls to the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, fiddlers Jenna Reid, Bruce MacGregor, Rua Macmillan and Kristan Harvey are joined by Anna Massie on guitar/fiddle and Angus Lyon on keyboard to deliver a musically intoxicating evening for all.  \n\nAlbum: The Old Style\n\n1 Bullocks\n2 Flora\n3 Sir James\n4 Catalina\n5 Athole Brose\n6 Three Steps\n7 Dancing on the Moon\n8 Strathmarches \n9 Sheiling\n10 Swedish\n11 Eejit\n\n320Kbs CDR Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baaea4f99a132202f9a091dc718b79beed3feb73","amp;dn":"The+Old+Style+Blazin%26rsquo%3B+Fiddles+%5B2002%5D+CDR+%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baaea4f99a132202f9a091dc718b79beed3feb73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,174,164,249,154,19,34,2,249,160,145,220,113,139,121,190,237,63,235,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

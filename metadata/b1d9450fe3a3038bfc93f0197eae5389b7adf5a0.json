For sisters Liz (Emily Mortimer), Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), that person is their perennially upbeat brother Ned (Paul Rudd), an erstwhile organic farmer whose willingness to rely on the honesty of mankind is a less-than-optimum strategy for a tidy, trouble-free existence. Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue. As Liz, Miranda and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines. But as each of their lives begins to unravel, Ned's family comes to realize that maybe, in believing and trusting the people around him; Ned isnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t such an idiot after all.\n\n\nGenre(s):\nComedy\n\nRun Time:\n95min. \n\nTheatrical Release Date:\n08/26/2011\n\nDVD Release Date:\n11/29/2011\n\nDirector(s):\nJesse Peretz\n\nStarring:\nZooey Deschanel , Elizabeth Banks , Paul Rudd , Emily Mortimer , Shirley Knight Hopkins\n\nThemes:\nSibling Relationships,Nothing Goes Right,Eccentric Families,Dropping Out\n\nTone:\nGoofy,Silly\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\nSub-Titles:\nSpanish, English\n\nProperties:\nVIDEO-\nLength: 01:29:51\nDecoder: mpeg2\nEncoder: h.264\nFrame Width x height: 720 x 480\nData rate: 879 kbps\nTotal bitrate: 1487 kbps\nFrame rate: 23 frames/second\nSubtitle track 1, English\nsubtitle track 2, Espanol\n\nAUDIO-\nDecoder: English (AC3) (5.1 ch)\nEncoder: faac\nBit Rate: 608 kbps\nChannels: 2(stereo)\nAudio sample rate: 48 khz\n\nEnglish audio is available.\nEnglish &amp; Spanish subtitles are available (on/off).\nI recommend using VLC media player, then select subtitles track.\nIt can be downloaded free at this link:     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease leave comments.\nPlease seed... at least upload as much as you downloaded!\nEnjoy~ Bakura2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d9450fe3a3038bfc93f0197eae5389b7adf5a0","amp;dn":"Our+Idiot+Brother+2011+DVDRip+Eng%28Span%2CEng+subs+avail.%29-by+Bakur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d9450fe3a3038bfc93f0197eae5389b7adf5a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,217,69,15,227,163,3,139,252,147,240,25,126,174,83,137,183,173,245,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

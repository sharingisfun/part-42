First released in Japan, in three parts, between 1959 and 1961, the film is a sprawling, crowded 10-hour epic of love, war, heroism and cruelty. Shot in a wide-screen format called Grandscope and set mainly in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation, it seems intent on leaving nothing out. Mountains, forest, marshlands; marriage, combat, hard labor; the call of duty and the obligations of conscience ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that over-reaching title turns out to be a pretty fair description of whatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s on screen.\n\nBut ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Human ConditionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ is also, and most memorably, an intimately scaled chronicle of individual experience. Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays its hero, an idealistic technocrat named Kaji, appears in nearly every frame, and it is his deeply personal anguish that provides an emotional anchor for this episodic, theme-heavy story. Mr. Nakadai, one of JapanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s great movie stars of the 1960s (and the subject of a fantastic retrospective at Film Forum that concludes with a three-week run of an immaculate new print of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Human ConditionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), looks a bit like a young Gregory Peck. And in this film he plays, as Peck often did, a liberal man of principle trying to uphold his ideals in difficult circumstances.\n\nTaller than most of the other people in the film, or at least photographed to look that way, Kaji occupies an elevated moral plane as well. In conditions that become, for him and those around him, increasingly harsh and perilous, he insists on doing the right thing and on prevailing by reason rather than by force. As a young manager for a Japanese mining company in Manchuria (then the puppet state of Manchukuo), he writes a report proposing improved conditions for Chinese workers. His boss is a bit skeptical, but nonetheless sends Kaji, along with his adoring wife, Michiko (Michiyo Aratama), out to the hinterlands to put his theories into practice.\n\nThe mine is both a world unto itself and a microcosm of the larger society, rather like a frontier town in an old western. And KajiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s experience there, detailed in the epic filmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s first and longest part, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½No Greater Love,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ sets the template for what will follow. In trying to implement basic reforms, he must first deal with the complacency of his superiors and the corruption of the work-gang bosses who control day-to-day underground activity, and then with the harsh, arrogant authoritarianism of the military police, who bring in prisoners of war for slave labor.\n\nKobayashi, who served in the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ repeatedly refusing promotion above the rank of private as a form of protest ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ presents a cleareyed, devastating critique of his countryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s military traditions, against which Kaji is ranged in an increasingly lonely and perilous struggle. After his experiment in bringing a measure of decency to the mine ends in personal catastrophe redeemed by a partial moral victory, he is conscripted into the army, where he tries, once again, to bring a measure of fairness and dignity to a system built on the corruption, coercion and the humiliation of the weak.\n\nEven as he tramps across the blasted countryside with a few surviving comrades, fleeing the triumphant Soviet Army in 1945 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and even after the Russians take him prisoner ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ KajiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s dogged reforming impulse survives. Bearded, ragged and wild-eyed, he takes on the air of a fanatic, but his zeal is always in the cause of gentleness and compassion.\n\nBack at the mine, a friend of KajiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s teases him for his high-minded moral ardor: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll ride the humanism train, no matter how much it costs you.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The metaphor may be a bit awkward in English, but it captures the spirit of the movie all the same. Kobayashi was one of the leading figures in postwar Japanese cinema, a peer of Akira Kurosawa and Kon Ichikawa, though his critical reputation abroad never quite matched theirs. He was also part of a broader humanist tendency in world cinema. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Human ConditionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was made at around the same time as Satyajit RayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ApuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ trilogy and Luchino ViscontiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Rocco and His Brothers,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and like them it is a work of large-scale realism grounded in a thorough but undogmatic left-wing political sensibility.\n\nPerhaps because it keeps a skeptical distance from Marxist ideology, which demands at least the prospect of a happy ending somewhere in the future, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Human ConditionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ takes a pessimistic, almost despairing view of its subject. Where is that train going? Some of KajiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s companions take a romantic view of JapanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Soviet enemy, imagining that it holds out a promise of democracy and equality. Kaji, though he is drawn to some aspects of Socialist thinking, never becomes a true believer, and ends up more of an existentialist hero than an exemplar of supposed political progress.\n\nAs such, he is very much a creature of his time ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the late 1950s, not the mid-ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½40s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Human ConditionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ can, in its speechifying moments, feel a bit creaky. But it is also, and more frequently, amazingly powerful in its emotional sweep and the depth of its historical insight. The human condition is murky, messy and perhaps unredeemable, but a great work of art can make you believe otherwise, however briefly (if nearly 10 hours counts as briefly). And whatever its flaws and infelicities ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ on such a large canvas the brushwork can hardly be perfect ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ KobayashiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s monumental film can clarify and enrich your understanding of what it is to be alive.\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galcfaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galcgaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galchaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galciaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galcjaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/galckaabg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n---my rip from custom subtitled DVD on ADC\n\n~~~~~~ Ningen no joken I.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................2,025,914,368\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................3:20:49\nFrame Count:....................................288881\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................256\nAspect Ratio:...................................2.625\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1224\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.297&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................108\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748b1ed3f183d4e98f1ec5f311b5a2879a32a959","amp;dn":"Ningen+no+joken+I+aka+The+Human+Condition+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748b1ed3f183d4e98f1ec5f311b5a2879a32a959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,139,30,211,241,131,212,233,143,30,197,243,17,181,162,135,154,50,169,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

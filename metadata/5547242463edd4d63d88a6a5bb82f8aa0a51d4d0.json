BusyBox is designed to be a small executable for use with the Linux kernel, which makes it ideal for use with embedded devices. It has been self-dubbed &quot;The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux&quot;.\n\nThis version includes 1.20.0, 1.19.4, 1.19.3, 1.19.2, and 1.18.5 no need to have more than that because it takes up space on your phone and each newer version will still contain the older features, unless I forgot to compile them in.\n\nLeave this installed if you always want to get the latest version of busybox!\n\nTorrent is working checked on micromax canvas-2\n\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+ ROOT\nInstructions :\nDownload App\nInstall APK\n\nSpecial Thanks To Admin And Other Member of {AMRG} RELEASERS GROUP\n\nPlease Seed After Download...!!\n\n\nPlease comment !

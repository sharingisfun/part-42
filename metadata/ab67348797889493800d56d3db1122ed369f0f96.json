The trips are frequent and long, and they have to stop often, as Matt gets sick. Sarah and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sarah finds a man putting up a &quot;For Rent&quot; sign in front of a large house. The man offers to sell her the house, noting that it has a bit of history, as it was formerly a funeral home. On the trip home, Matt is in extreme pain, so Sarah drives back to the house, where they stay for the night. Matt hears strange noises and sees his reflection become distorted, but writes the events off as a dream.The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary (Sophi Knight), and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, which also has a mysterious door, later discovered to lead to the old morgue room. After moving into the house, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. He also sees strange creatures and appears to his family to be having blackouts.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: The Haunting In Connecticut 2009 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1797.89 MiB\nDuration: 1h 42mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 444 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-03-07 07:10:02\nSubtitles: English,Romanian\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 120 r2164 da19765\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: SiNNERS Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/11362143077349441990.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/11362143077349441990.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/42892863414678275991.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/42892863414678275991.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/58231217255216620399.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/58231217255216620399.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23909542377053326215.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23909542377053326215.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: AB67348797889493800D56D3DB1122ED369F0F96\n\n@@@  @@@  @@@   @@@@@@@  @@@@@@@@  \n@@@  @@@  @@@  @@@@@@@@  @@@@@@@@  \n@@!  @@@  @@!  !@@       @@!       \n!@!  @!@  !@!  !@!       !@!       \n@!@  !@!  !!@  !@!       @!!!:!    \n!@!  !!!  !!!  !!!       !!!!!:    \n:!:  !!:  !!:  :!!       !!:       \n ::!!:!   :!:  :!:       :!:       \n  ::::     ::   ::: :::   :: ::::  \n   :      :     :: :: :  : :: ::   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab67348797889493800d56d3db1122ed369f0f96","amp;dn":"The+Haunting+In+Connecticut+2009+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab67348797889493800d56d3db1122ed369f0f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,103,52,135,151,136,148,147,128,13,86,211,219,17,34,237,54,159,15,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

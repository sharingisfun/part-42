The only thing wrong is that there should be more of them - only three tracks after 1969.  Essential for Elvis fans.  I think I posted these some years ago.  There are lots of new faces here since then so they're worth putting back on the tracker.  New scans for Box 4 as I couldn't find any and I don't think I ever got around to them.  Boxes 1-3 are the original scans I did way back when.  Completely new rip.\n\t \n  \t \t \t  \t \nSet List:\n\nVolume 12\n \t \t\n01 Without Him (take 1)\n02 Without Him (take 8)\n03 Without Him (takes 6, 10, 14)\n04 If The Lord Wasn't Walking By My Side (take 1)\n05 If The Lord Wasn't Walking By My Side (take 4)\n06 If The Lord Wasn't Walking By My Side (take 6)\n07 Fools Fall In Love\n08 Indescribably Blue\n09 Indescribably Blue (overdub take 1)\n10 Indescribably Blue (overdub take 2)\n11 Indescribably Blue (edit piece take 2)\n12 I'll Remember You\n13 I'll Remember You (overdub take 1)\n14 I'll Remember You (overdub take 2)\n15 I'll Remember You (overdub take 3)\n16 I'll Remember You\n17 If Everyday Was Like Christmas\n18 If Everyday Was Like Christmas\n19 Singing Tree\n20 We Call On Him (take 2)\n21 We Call On Him (take 3)\n22 You'll Never Walk Alone (take 2)\n\nVolume 13\n\n01 True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n02 True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n03 True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n04 True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n05 True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n06 And The Grass Won't Pay No Mind (2 versions)\n07 And The Grass Won't Pay No Mind\n08 And The Grass Won't Pay No Mind\n09 Power Of My Love (take 1)\n10 Power Of My Love (take 2)\n11 Power Of My Love (takes 3-6)\n12 Power Of My Love (take 7)\n13 Power Of My Love (take 8)\n14 After Loving You\n15 After Loving You\n16 Do You Know Who I Am\n17 Do You Know Who I Am\n\nVolume 14\n\n01 Do You Know Who I Am\n02 Do You Know Who I Am\n03 Do You Know Who I Am\n04 Do You Know Who I Am\n05 It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin'\n06 It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin'\n07 Any Day Now\n08 Any Day Now\n09 Any Day Now\n10 Any Day Now\n11 Any Day Now\n\nVolume 15\n\n01 Rubberneckin' (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n02 Rubberneckin' (takes 3-5)\n03 Rubberneckin' (take 6)\n04 Instrumental\n05 Instrumental\n06 Instrumental\n07 Instrumental\n08 Instrumental\n09 Instrumental\n10 Instrumental\n11 Instrumental No 2\n12 I Got A Thing About You Baby\n13 I Got A Thing About You Baby\n14 The Wonderful World Of Christmas\n\n\nRipped by Ozark and uploaded to Hunger City February 2012\n\n\nNotes From Elvis On CD\n\nThe last box of a series of four wonderful boxsets in an outstanding sound quality.

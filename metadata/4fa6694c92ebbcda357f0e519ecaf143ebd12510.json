Some of the topics are Lundberg's inequality, the CramÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©r-Lundberg approximation, exact solutions, other approximations (e.g., for heavy-tailed claim size distributions), finite horizon ruin probabilities, extensions of the classical compound Poisson model to allow for reserve-dependent premiums, Markov-modulation, periodicity, change of measure techniques, phase-type distributions as a computational vehicle and the connection to other applied probability areas, like queueing theory. In this substantially updated and extended second version, new topics include stochastic control, fluctuation theory for Levy processes, Gerber-Shiu functions and dependence.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 620 pages\n# Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company; 2 edition (September 30, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9814282529\n# ISBN-13: 978-9814282529","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa6694c92ebbcda357f0e519ecaf143ebd12510","amp;dn":"Ruin+Probabilities+%28Vol+14%29%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa6694c92ebbcda357f0e519ecaf143ebd12510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,166,105,76,146,235,188,218,53,127,14,81,158,202,241,67,235,209,37,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I am no longer seeding that torrent.\n\nContains demos &amp; album tracks from the band's brief but important studio career (1966-68).  Disc 4 holds the first two albums, &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again,&quot; with the first album in mono as God (or the artists) intended.\n\nDisc 4 repeats tracks from the first 3 discs.  Discs 1, 2 &amp; 3 are the essence of this collection.  Since you're not paying for it, it's nice to have the fourth disc isn't it -- a stand-alone disc of great Buffalo Springfield albums!  A lot of consumers thought they were being ripped off when they had to pay for four discs containing only three discs of music.  But that quibble aside, this is a valuable addition to the Buffalo Springfield discography and definitely worth an investment of time &amp; attention.  \n\nDisc: 1\n1. There Goes My Babe (demo)\n2.

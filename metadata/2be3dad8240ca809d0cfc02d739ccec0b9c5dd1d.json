It was developed by Cross and released in 2000.\n\nThe game follows an Indiana Jones-style storyline in which the player character flies through several areas of a fictional world, collecting artifacts as well as pieces of a map. The adventure mode of the game focuses on reaching the hidden tower of Maximus, which is located on one of four uncharted islands which are explored in the game.\n\nPCSX2 1.0 plus plugins &amp; bios are included along with setup pictures to help those who have never used PCSX2.

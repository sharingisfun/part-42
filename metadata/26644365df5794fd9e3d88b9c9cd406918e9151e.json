The Prince Igor here is heard without the usual choral antics, which is both refreshing but also very surprising (personally, I do prefer it with voices). \nWhen it comes to Scheherezade, the playing is both exhilirating and incredibly accurate all at the same time. The violin solo is of particular noteworthiness: the tricky second movement is tackled with flawless bravura playing, while the final high 'E' harmonic in the final bars of the last movement floats with no cracks or other embellishments. \nIf you want the definitive Scheherezade recording, this has got to be it. A real bargain.

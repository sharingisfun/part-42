One such states that once he was ploughing his fields. Large number of sanyasis came to him and demanded food. He gifted all the seed kept for sowing to them and ploughed fields without seeds. The fields produced no food grains but the gourds. When Jagirdar came to collect the levy he offered two gourds. The Jagirdar broke the gourds and found that they were full of pearls. There is a proverb Meaning - Dhanna Jat had so much love with God that fields produced foodgrain without seeds.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Bhagat Dhanna Jatt (1974)\nWhen Laali, who loves Shyamu, refuses to marry Kalidas, recommended by her aunt, her naive brother, Dhanna, and Bhabhi, Bhagwanti, are asked to leave and till a barren piece of land. When Dhanna is unable to grow anything, he decides to take the assistance of Thakara, none other than Bhagwan Shri Vishnu. He approaches Pandit Tirlochan in order to take the Diety to his residence. Tirlochan cons him by giving him a rock instead, and he brings it home, refuses to feed himself until and unless the Thakara shares his humble offerings. As a result, the entire community, including Laali and Bhagwanti, think Dhanna has lost his mind. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 609 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 112kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Punjabi\nRunTime: 2:15:45\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 2:15:45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c89d79af15723db4e38b68f83281ec77688807bc","amp;dn":"Bhagat+Dhanna+Jatt+%281974%29+Punjabi_Xvid+1cd_Eng+Subs+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c89d79af15723db4e38b68f83281ec77688807bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,157,121,175,21,114,61,180,227,139,104,248,50,129,236,119,104,136,7,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But how many of these tales are true? For most prisoners of war, life was nothing like the films, but for a few brave escapees, fact was more extraordinary than fiction... Using personal accounts, authentic reports from German guards and debrief documents in the National Archives, this is the true story of the many exciting escape attempts from POW camps during the Second World War. Some were successful, others not, but in each case the inspired methods devised and executed by the prisoners show bravery and ingenuity on a greater scale than any film. With incredible stories such as the 'Wooden Horse', the 'French Tunnel' and the 'Colditz Ghost', this ground-breaking new book tells the stories of some of the bravest men in history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f065810cb1da23a469213023b633afc892e01cf3","amp;dn":"Great+Escapes+by+Terry+Treadwell+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f065810cb1da23a469213023b633afc892e01cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,101,129,12,177,218,35,164,105,33,48,35,182,51,175,200,146,224,28,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

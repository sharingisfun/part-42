Born of competition and rivalry (the Breton fishermen are accused of poaching crabs from the sea nearby) which develops through romance and jealousy, to one where everyone pulls together for the common good. From calls at the beginning that &quot;Johnny Frenchman&quot; should be sent back where they came from, to claims that &quot;we are friends at last&quot; and that the two villages have become one, this is fairly populist propaganda about European neighbours and post-war partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 528x400, 25.000 fps, 1163 Kbps, 01h40m23s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 224 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4yr13as6x/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4digm1tad/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/66ldadeh1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jc0vgh8cl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/lhv6azbt1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82e9a23a49e93ccdb3cf38fd46e0439000e67d8","amp;dn":"Johnny+Frenchman+%281945+-+United+Kingdom%29+Ealing+Studios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82e9a23a49e93ccdb3cf38fd46e0439000e67d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,46,154,35,164,158,147,204,219,60,243,143,212,110,4,57,0,14,103,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

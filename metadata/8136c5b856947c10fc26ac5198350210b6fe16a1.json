They made their first records for Federal, a subsidiary of Cincinnati's King Records. These early sides don't sound anything like the better-known sides that would eventually emerge from this group, instead merely aping the current R&amp;B trends and styles of the day. What changed their fortunes can be reduced down to one very important name: their mentor, manager, producer, songwriter, and vocal coach, Buck Ram. Ram took what many would say were a run-of-the-mill R&amp;B doo wop vocal group and turned them into stars and one of the most enduring and lucrative groups of all time. By 1954, Ram was already running a talent agency in Los Angeles, writing and arranging for publisher Mills Music, managing the Three Suns -- a pop group with some success -- and working with his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s, the Penguins. The Platters seemed like a good addition to his stable.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-platters-p5154/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-platters-p5154/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by John Bush):\n\nA double-disc, 50-track extravaganza from one of the paragons of smooth soul, The Magic Touch: An Anthology is the most complete look at the Platters, barring only Bear Family's 1994 box set Four Platters and One Lovely Dish. Between 1955 and 1962, the quintet recorded 36 entries that reached the pop charts and they're all here, led by the ones that absolutely must be on any effective Platters compilation: &quot;Only You (And You Alone),&quot; &quot;The Great Pretender,&quot; &quot;(You've Got) The Magic Touch,&quot; &quot;My Prayer,&quot; &quot;Twilight Time,&quot; &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,&quot; &quot;Harbor Lights,&quot; and &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset.&quot; That leaves plenty of room for the type of material collectors drool over, like the previously unreleased &quot;Hula Hop&quot; and a rare Tony Williams solo record (&quot;When You Return&quot;), plus obscure Platters versions of songs made famous by others (&quot;The Glory of Love,&quot; &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart, It's Time to Go,&quot; &quot;My Old Flame,&quot; even an enjoyable stab at &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;). It's all delivered in the sweetest sound heard yet, with a lengthy booklet and many superb photos. It's the ultimate Platters anthology, and it's everything this important group deserves.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-magic-touch-an-anthology-r15396&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-magic-touch-an-anthology-r15396&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001DTF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001DTF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.

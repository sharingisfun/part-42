Rufus had a huge influence on Hank. A teenage Hank put together the Drifting Cowboys to play live on the radio. At 23, he met Nashville music publisher Fred Rose, and recorded the tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Move It On OverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the rest is history.\nThere have been many different lyrics used on this song over the years. Ricky Nelson has a rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ version of this song, and he changed the lyric from Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy no beerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work no moreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great jazz version out there by Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis. The rhythm section are my bandmates in RancidÃ¢â‚¬â€œMatt and Branden, and this is our take on it.\n \nTim Timebomb-Vocals,Guitar\nJason Myers-Guitar\nMatt Freeman-Bass,Mandolin\nBranden Steineckert-Drums\nRyan Foltz-BG Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fdd94c9a24d17a53569e5b4b89aea7b1cf63bd1","amp;dn":"My+Bucket%27s+Got+A+Hole+In+It+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fdd94c9a24d17a53569e5b4b89aea7b1cf63bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,221,148,201,162,77,23,165,53,105,229,180,184,154,234,123,28,246,59,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

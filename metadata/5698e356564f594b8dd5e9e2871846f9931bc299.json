It demonstrates how \nMiami especially became a key importation state which was initially used for hauling vast amounts \nof cannabis and later coca around the USA. \n\nThose interesting in narco-trafficking will find this film backs up the position that the Drug War \nis a sham, a false flag psi-op. We find at this level there exists no boundary between mafia and state \n- everyone has a price. We find also that illicit narcotics are an intrinsic element of an economy to \nthe point where pulling this from global currency flows would lead to instant collapse.\n\nThis documentary also demonstrates the ongoing models used by the same covert ops teams which began shipping\n heroin in Asia in the Vietnam era and continued to cocaine in central and south america - leading to the \nIran Contra situation. It&amp;#039;s this same state mafia who were at the core of events on Septermber 11th 2001.\n\nMore on Narco trafficking and the ongoing war on consciousness: http://tinyurl.com/qe5u8\n======================================================================\n\nBest Viewed with !DAMN!

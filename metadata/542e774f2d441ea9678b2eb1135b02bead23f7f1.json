As the war heats up in Europe, police inspector Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen, &quot;Reckless&quot;, &quot;Our of Africa&quot;) is prevented from enlisting by his superiors who need his talent at home. Foyle is an everyday detective, waging war against local crime in an atmosphere suffused with extraordinary personal and social turmoil.\n\n----------\n\nI&amp;#039;m uploading this and will upload the second series when this torrent have enough seeds as I only have 0.5Mbit.

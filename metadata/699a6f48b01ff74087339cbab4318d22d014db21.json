Mostly farm animals. Not to horrific, to be honest. More 'nudge wink' horror than fear inducing scary horror. But still very entertaining with a some nice artwork in places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699a6f48b01ff74087339cbab4318d22d014db21","amp;dn":"Barn+Of+Fear+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699a6f48b01ff74087339cbab4318d22d014db21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,154,111,72,176,31,247,64,135,51,156,186,180,49,141,34,208,20,219,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

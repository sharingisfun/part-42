The group made four charting albums for the label, the second two under the more democratic name of the Mitchell Trio, after which Chad Mitchell quit and was replaced by a young John Denver. Two non-charting albums followed before they left Mercury in 1966. This is a good compilation of that material, featuring songs written by such folk luminaries as Tom Paxton including &quot;The Marvelous Toy,&quot; the trio's biggest hit, Ian Tyson, and Phil Ochs. Those cheery harmonies, often expressing topically satiric sentiments in such songs as &quot;Alma Mater&quot; about college integration struggles, &quot;Barry's Boys&quot; about Barry Goldwater, and &quot;The Draft Dodger Rag,&quot; still sound fresh and funny, if inevitably dated. The seven tracks featuring Denver have historical interest, especially since three of them are his compositions, including a 1965 version of &quot;For Bobbi.&quot; Of course, to be really comprehensive, a compilation would have to contain material from both the Kapp and Mercury catalogs, but this disc tells the second half of the trio's story well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a3b7357a65e58bf2184462483db0ddc9561e3e","amp;dn":"The+Chad+Mitchell+Trio+-+The+Best+of++The+Chad+Mitchell+Trio+%28Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a3b7357a65e58bf2184462483db0ddc9561e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,163,183,53,122,101,229,139,242,24,68,98,72,61,176,221,201,86,30,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

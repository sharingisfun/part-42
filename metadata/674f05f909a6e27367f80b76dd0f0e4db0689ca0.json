For almost three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire, allied under the Khitomer Accords, have contended with the nascent coalition on a predominantly cold-war footing. But as Starfleet rebuilds itself, factions within the Typhon Pact grow restive, concerned about their own inability to develop a quantum slipstream drive to match that of the Federation. Will leaders such as UFP President Bacco and RSE Praetor Kamemor bring about a lasting peace across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, or will the cold war between the two alliances deepen, and perhaps even lead to an all-out shooting war?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674f05f909a6e27367f80b76dd0f0e4db0689ca0","amp;dn":"David+R.+George+III+-+Star+Trek.Typhon+Pact.Plagues+of+Night+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674f05f909a6e27367f80b76dd0f0e4db0689ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,79,5,249,9,166,226,115,103,248,11,118,221,15,14,77,176,104,156,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The cartoons follow the daily life of a buying clerk who works in the monolithic Chester-Perry building. \n\nHe is a fantasist and has delusions of grandeur, wishing he was a brain surgeon and a writer. \n\nHe lives in a small bedsit in East Winchley and commutes to work by train, invariably arriving late. \n\nBristow is surrounded by co-workers, Fudge (his overbearing manager), Jones, Dimkins, Miss Sunman, master chef Gordon Blue, and the tealadies. \n\nBristow was made into a BBC Radio series starring the late Michael Williams. \n\n\nCast:\nMichael Williams as Bristow \nRodney Bewes as Jones \nOwen Brenman as Hewitt \nDora Bryan as Mrs Purdy the tea lady \nJohn Glover as Fudge the manager \nKaty Ody as Miss Sunman \nSimon Schatzberger as the Post Boy \nCarol Starkes as Miss Peach and the Liftboy \nDavid Batley as Fred Stoats \nRobert Bathurst as Mr Moorcroft the Director \nSheila Reid as Mrs Dimple \nJacky Neglia as Sylvana \nPeter Kelly as Mr Witherspoon \nLiz Fraser as Gert \nJoan Sims as Daisy \nLeslie Philips as Mr Perkins \nBernard Cribbens as Dan Quartly \nLucy Ackhurst as Miss Samantha Golightly \nRoyce Mills as Clement \nRoger Lloyd-Pack as Mr Hickford \nJackie Neglier as Sylvana \n\nWritten by Frank Dickens\n\n\n\n\nBristow - S01 - E01 - Fair Shares\nBristow - S01 - E02 - Follow That Star\nBristow - S01 - E03 - The Girl Next Door\nBristow - S01 - E04 - Sun, Sea And Sabotage\nBristow - S01 - E05 - Stranger On A Train\nBristow - S01 - E06 - The Great Escape \n\nBristow - S02 - E01 - When Melancholy Autumn Comes To Chester-Perry\nBristow - S02 - E02 - The Power Of The Press\nBristow - S02 - E03 - Mr Bristow Regrets\nBristow - S02 - E04 - The Girl In The Yellow Overcoat\n\nBristow - S03 - E04 - Repaying Mr Piper\nBristow - S03 - E01 - Of Moles And Men\nBristow - S03 - E03 - Chapter And Verse\nBristow - S03 - E04 - Repaying Mr Piper\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7c2fa39a85280807f5731aca21c85d8e574149","amp;dn":"Bristow+-+S01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7c2fa39a85280807f5731aca21c85d8e574149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,124,47,163,154,133,40,8,7,245,115,26,202,33,200,93,142,87,65,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

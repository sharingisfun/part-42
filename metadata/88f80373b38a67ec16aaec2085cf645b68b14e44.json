This marks Andy's first official release in the U.S. (hard to believe).\r\n\r\nAndy on the record:\r\n&quot;Steve and I decided to re-release some early material along with some new tunes as kind of an introduction to what I hope will be a new fan base! Plus, I think the fans I've been blessed with from the start will really dig the new tracks and the way the earlier tunes sound re-mastered! I'm really proud of this collection...and to be on the same label with Steve Lukather, Larry Carlton, and Eric Johnson is mind-blowing!&quot;\r\n\r\nMUSICIANS:\r\n\r\nAndy - guitars, bass, drums, vocals\r\nMike Daane - bass\r\nMitch Marine - drums\r\nDan Wojciechowski - drums (12,13,14,16)\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nProduced by Andy Timmons\r\nEngineered, mixed and co-produced by Rob Wechsler.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING\r\n\r\n1.

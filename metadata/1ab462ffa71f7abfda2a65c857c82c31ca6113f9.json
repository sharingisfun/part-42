Schriffin)\n\nThe last three tracks were by the films' original composer Lalo Schriffin but were not used in the final cut. Apparently the director William Friedkin, known for his short temper, listened to these tracks in Schrffin's company after he had finished recording them. Friedkin then stood up, took the tape out of the player, walked with them to the entrance of the studio and threw them across the street ! Adding something like &quot;there's no way that shit is going on my film&quot;.

Occupied since the Bronze Age, Edinburgh took shape during the 11th century--and soon after tales of ghosts and goblins began to surface. Scary locations on our tour include: Holyrood Palace, rumored to be haunted by Mary, Queen of Scots, and her Italian secretary David Rizzio, who was murdered there; and an abandoned underground city, where thousands died during the 1645 plague.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 42:42\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso Supported by \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c4fe5f0e23d988b28d81adc3992f891c13ed755","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Haunted+History+-+Haunted+Edinburgh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c4fe5f0e23d988b28d81adc3992f891c13ed755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,79,229,240,226,61,152,139,40,216,26,220,57,146,248,145,193,62,215,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

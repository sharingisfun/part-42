This is the first time that a local government in Japan has ever invested in the production of a dramatic feature film. In Hitosuji, a fictitious village of the sort to be found everywhere in rural Japan, everyday life goes on as it always has around a man who does nothing but sleep.\nThere are mountains, forests, rivers and fields; the seasons come and go, but life and death, humankind and nature, are portrayed in unity rather than in their conventional opposition. Underlying SLEEPING MAN are the traditional Japanese attitudes to nature, to life and to death.\nThe past century has brought the rapid modernization of the country and the forcible turn of the Japanese mind towards Europe and North America in the economic development following World War II. The price, however, has been high, as the Japanese now find themselves bereft of an inner life with which to live through the ages to come. In this film, Oguri tries to extract the richness of the ,life' that Japan has lost.\nIn casting the film, Oguri realized a long-cherished desire to transcend the national boundaries of Asia. In the role of Takuji, the sleeping man - a Japanese - is the Korean actor Sung-ki Ahn.\nThe part of Tia, one of the Asians its economic development has brought to Japan, is played by an Indonesian actress, Christine Hakim, star of the film Tjoet Nja' Dhien. Koji Yakusho, who plays the electrician Kamimura, Takuji's friend, is an actor known throughout the Japanese film industry.\nThe Noh sequence of the film features Tessenkai and Akio Kanze, both famous in their field.\n\nAfter a long time, we have a masterpiece of Japanese cinema.\nIt is rich in content, with beautiful images. Nature - the river, the forest and the mountains - is portrayed in its full presence, in contrast with the trivial details of everyday life. The film takes the aspects of the natural cycle, and evokes the communication between human beings and nature that comes with their return to it. At its deepest level, the film deals with life and death.\nThe sleeping man himself can represent nothing other than the soul that looks out over the panorama of life and death.\nDirector Oguri, in his quiet portrayal of a little country town, makes it a light source that illuminates the nation of Japan in its entirety. With its ear on the pulse of the age, the film considers humanity and the world. He achieves his effect through his images and his techniques of suggestion, and one must not forget the poetry conjured by these images and the care with which he has selected his cast.\n\nThis is a highly praiseworthy film that cannot fail to leave a strong spiritual impression on the viewer.

This was originally just a folder that was going to be sent to a friend but due to complications i've decided to upload it here and allow everyone to download it! So this is the Fallout: New Vegas you all know and love with every single dlc that's available. It also contains game enhancing mods that not only lengthen the game but also make it more visually appealing while optimizing the game's resources to make it run much more smoothly. You will need to have Nexus Mod Manager to access the modded content but it is barely even a hassle. This is the easiest way to download Fallout: New Vegas with all the dlc and with mods ready to go.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n SOME BUT NOT ALL MODS INSTALLED IN THIS TORRENT | 47 MODS TOTAL\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n~ New Vegas Script Extender\n~ EVE - Essential Video Enhancements\n~ Electro City - Relighting The Wasteland\n~ Classic Fallout Weapons\n~ Improved Ironsight Animations\n~ Gun Runners Actually Run Guns\n~ Halo Reach DMR\n~ New Vegas Bounties 1 AND 2\n \n *COMPLETE LIST OF MODS* &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://prntscr.com/3l408f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://prntscr.com/3l408f&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------\n RANDOM SCREENSHOTS\n--------------------\n1. http://prntscr.com/3l414c \n2. http://prntscr.com/3l41gy\n3. http://prntscr.com/3l41nl\n4. http://prntscr.com/3l41to\n5. http://prntscr.com/3l420q\n\n---------------\n PREREQUISITES\n---------------\n- You'll need to download these things in order to successfully run the actual game\n and also to run the mods properly.\n\n~ Nexus Mod Manager\n - You'll need to make an account and download the free open beta.\n  &gt; http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/modmanager/?\n\n~ DirectX Update Patch\n - BillionUploads is stupid but we have to use it. Click &quot;Download or Watch&quot; then\n  uncheck the box under &quot;DOWNLOAD&quot;. Now click download!\n  &gt;\n\n~ NetFrameWorks For Games\n - BillionUploads is stupid but we have to use it. Click &quot;Download or Watch&quot; then\n  uncheck the box under &quot;DOWNLOAD&quot;. Now click download!\n  &gt;\n\n~ Visual C++ 2012\n - BillionUploads is stupid but we have to use it. Click &quot;Download or Watch&quot; then\n  uncheck the box under &quot;DOWNLOAD&quot;. Now click download!\n  &gt;\n\n--------------\n INSTRUCTIONS\n--------------\nThis won't be complicated if you follow this &quot;guide&quot; step by step. I've tried to make it as easy to follow. You'll need half a brain and basic computer skills.\n\n1. Download this torrent. \n\n2. Unzip the folder, place it on your desktop. \n  *You'll need WinRar or 7zip to do this.*\n\n3. That shouldn't of been too hard. Your screen should look something like this\n  screenshot: http://prntscr.com/3l43io\n\n4. Create a folder inside your &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot; and name it &quot;Bethesda\n  Softworks&quot;. The address bar at the top of your Windows Explorer should look\n  similar to this after you've completed this step: http://prntscr.com/3l468a\n\n5. Double click your newly installed &quot;Fallout New Vegas&quot; folder and find the\n  application inside of it called &quot;nvse_loader&quot;. If you're having trouble it would\n  look something like this: http://prntscr.com/3l4780\n\n6. Right click that and click &quot;Create shortcut&quot;. It won't allow you to place it in\n  the folder so click okay and it will place it on the desktop for you.\n\n7. Locate it on the desktop, then right click it and scroll down to properties.\n  Once inside the properties make it so the application will always be run as an\n  administrator. It'd look like this: http://prntscr.com/3l48dh\n\n8. AT THIS POINT MAKE SURE YOU'VE DOWNLOADED ALL THE PREREQUISITES!\n\n9. Run Nexus Mod Manager as an administrator then select Fallout: New Vegas. \n\n10. You'll now see the Nexus Mod Manager interface, with every mod having a big red\n  x to the left of the title. Double click each mod! This will enable every mod and \n  allow them to run when you start up the game.\n\n11. This SHOULD word. The game should run &quot;perfectly&quot; fine with every dlc and mod\n  integrated into the game.\n\n\n--------------\n GAME DETAILS\n--------------\n\n~ Year: 2012 (19 October 2010)\n~ Genre : Action, RPG\n~ Developer : Obsidian Entertainment\n~ Publisher : Bethesda Softworks\n~ Publication Type: Repak\n~ Language: English\n\n--------------------\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n--------------------\n\n~ Operating system : Windows Ã‚Â® XP / Vista / 7\n~ Processor : Intel Pentium D / AMD Athlon 64 X2\n~ Memory : 1,5 GB ( for XP) / 2 GB ( for Vista / 7)\n~ Video: 128 MB (GeForce 6600GT / Radeon X1300XT)\n~ Sound Card: sovmestimoya with DirectX9.0\n~ Free hard drive space: 10 GB + More for mods \n\n\n------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------\n PLEASE SEED AND COMMENT   PLEASE SEED AND COMMENT   PLEASE SEED AND COMMENT \n------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6d1e88b45be9dce445c2b3db13e0901a7f203d","amp;dn":"Fallout+New+Vegas+-+Ultimate+Edition+%2B+47+Mods+%7C+Volify","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6d1e88b45be9dce445c2b3db13e0901a7f203d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,109,30,136,180,91,233,220,228,69,194,179,219,19,224,144,26,127,32,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

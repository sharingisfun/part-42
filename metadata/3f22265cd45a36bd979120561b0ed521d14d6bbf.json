The narrative integrates political, military, social, and cultural history, with a focus on the development of the Greek city-state in the eighth to fourth centuries B.C. and on the society, literature, and architecture of Athens in its Golden Age. The book, which includes useful timelines, maps, plans, and photographs, was adapted from and may be cross-referenced with the historical overview of Greece that is part of the multimedia interactive database 'Perseus; Interactive Sources and Studies on Ancient Greece', versions 1.0 and 2.0. The book extends the coverage of the Perseus overview, with its new sections on Greek prehistory, the Bronze and Dark Ages, and the Hellenistic period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f22265cd45a36bd979120561b0ed521d14d6bbf","amp;dn":"Ancient+Greece%3A+From+Prehistoric+to+Hellenistic+Times","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f22265cd45a36bd979120561b0ed521d14d6bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,34,38,92,212,90,54,189,151,145,32,86,27,14,213,33,209,77,107,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

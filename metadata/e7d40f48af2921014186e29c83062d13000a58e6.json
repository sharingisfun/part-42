Just wait.  Takes less time if you are just switching\nlanguages within same region.\n\nAlso realize if you play on a private server that is english based then not everything\nwill be in your language.  Quest descriptions will not be in your language.  But items,\nmenus, chat stuff, menus, maps, etc will be in your language.\n\nYou can switch locale back and forth if you choose.  You will only loose Cache data\nand this is rebuilt automatically.\n\nSometimes I notice after switching languages it hangs on connecting to realm.  You\ncan try to cancel and login again if you see this happen.\n\nPlease have patience while data is loaded!  You can monitor your data files and see them grow if you like.\nOr if your geeky you can use tcpdump via terminal: sudo tcpdump | grep http\n\nTech:\nNA shares base data with enUS esMX\nEU shares base data with deDE enGB esES frFR ruRU\nTW shares base data with zhTW enTW\nKR ... dont have valid mfil ...\nCN ... dont have valid mfil ...\n\nCould likely use a higher mfil for KR and CN and still work but didn't bother finding one.\nIf you want to research and find correct CN/KR mfils or compatible ones with client\nbuild 13623 feel free to give them to me for inclusion. google away!\n\n-HR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7d40f48af2921014186e29c83062d13000a58e6","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+-+Cataclysm+4.0.6a+MacOS+Multi+Lang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7d40f48af2921014186e29c83062d13000a58e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,212,15,72,175,41,33,1,65,134,226,156,131,6,45,19,0,10,88,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Conflict  has  aroused when Xarax, ruler of \n Gods  of  Bellarion,  was  murdered.  Each of the remaining\n Gods  claimed  the  right for the Divine Throne. After many\n quarrels,  they  all  agreed  that  they should arrange the\n Ultimate  Challenge in which all the Gods would cross their\n powers to show who is the most powerful to rule them all.\n But  the  Gods  who failed were still not willing to submit\n to  the winner. They summoned their armies and attacked the\n worshipers   of   other   Gods.  By  the  deaths  of  their\n worshipers, Gods lost part of their power and weakened.\n This deed could not have been left without reply.\n\n After  2000 years of battles, Bellarion lies in ruins. Vast \n black  deserts  of  ashes,  chasms  sinking  into the lava,\n earth  torn  and  frozen into the lifeless glacier Ã‚Â¹ thatÃƒÂ£s\n what  most  of  Bellarion  remained. Gods with their armies \n fortified  in  the  heavily protected fortresses and sealed\n their  territories with deadly magic traps. All those years\n the battle was drawn. Nobody could win. Untill...\n\n The  God  of  Darkness,  Mortagorn, found a new weapon. \n New Clerics from his castles appeared in the battlefields.\n Each  of them armed with a pale crystal at the end of their\n staves.  When  a cold light shone at the direction of their\n enemies,  soldiers  just  fell  dead to the ground. \n Neither magical nor physical protection was effective.\n\n As  the  last  hope,  Arswaargh,  the  God of Fire, created \n Vivien  from  his  own astral body and sent her through the\n space  and  time  to seek other worlds where there might be\n the counter-weapon he needed.\n\n The  game starts when Vivien opens her eyes in the world of\n Antasion,  completely  unknown for her. Unfortunately, when\n Vivien  traveled  through  the  magical  portal  to another\n world,  she  disrupted  the divine balance of the new world\n and  her  own  divine essence was scattered into sparks and\n absorbed  equally  by  the  gods  of  Antasion. Without her\n divine  essence,  Vivien  becomes  a  mortal being as other\n inhabitants  of  Antasion.  She  must seek the Gods of this\n new  world, gain back her power and seek the counter-weapon\n against MortagornÃƒÂ£s death crystals.   \n\n:. review .: \n\nwww.gamespot.com &lt; or &gt; www.tothegame.com\n\n\n:.

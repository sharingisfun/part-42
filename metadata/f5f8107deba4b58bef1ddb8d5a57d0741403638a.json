Trapped in the past, Iron Man races the clock to save the future from annihilation. But his past self is in a drunken stupor, and Tony's fellow Avengers dismiss his story as an alcoholic delusion. The keys to saving Tony's future? Hank Pym, exiled Avenger - and one of the team's greatest enemies: Ultron! Tony's next stop is Captain Britain's London, a totalitarian state bent on a new, &quot;cleaner&quot; future. Iron Man and Captain Britain fight for freedom - but can any of the crosstime allies Tony gathers help him defeat Dark Phoenix, the foe threatening all of time? Written by Rob Williams, published by Marvel. All credit to original scanners. Please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f8107deba4b58bef1ddb8d5a57d0741403638a","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+-+Iron+Age+%282011%2C+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f8107deba4b58bef1ddb8d5a57d0741403638a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,248,16,125,235,164,181,139,239,29,219,141,90,87,208,116,20,3,99,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Bill FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happens to be all three.\nAfter two distinctly powerful and ignored albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Bill Fay and the following yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Time of the Last Persecution, whose title alone indicates an already wearying state of mind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fay went into exodus. Twenty-seven years passed before his reputation was salvaged when both albums were reissued in 1998, with previously unheard material and WilcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Be Not So Fearful feeding the cult worship.\nArriving 41 years after FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last original studio album, Life Is People represents the return of a prodigal son you never knew existed. Its religious symbolism is inspired by FayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own relationship with faith, the result a stunning, profound, moving and soulful record.\nFayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never preachy, his questioning the kind you might expect from a brilliant mind who, at one point, worked as a factory cleaner. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s environmental awareness, existential drama and considered advice. If Father Time made an album, it might sound like Life Is People.\nFayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep-set voice and the music both rise to the occasion. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a string quartet, a gospel choir on Empires and Be at Peace with Yourself, and some judiciously employed guitar (his principal collaborator is Paul Weller sidekick Matt Deighton). The organ/piano foundations sometimes echo Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild mercury sound, and can be reminiscent of early Mott the HoopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rolling, wistful, valiant feel.\nBut mostly, Life Is People is just hugely moving. Sad, too, but a comforting Nick Drake-style sad, so you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it any other way. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope as well, even if The Never Ending Happening and The Healing Day undermine their titles with the feeling Fay is writing his epitaph.\nThis WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening line is, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got me in its grip / ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t no way can I wriggle out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yet Cosmic Concerto (Life Is People) starts out with, Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are miracles in the strangest of places.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ One of those miracles is that Fay, after so many years, is again making music.\nAnother miracle is how brilliant Life Is People is. Redemption time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64356535b9aff5a3e7e1c384f3db8fbba8c566fb","amp;dn":"Bill+Fay+-+Life+Is+People+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64356535b9aff5a3e7e1c384f3db8fbba8c566fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,53,101,53,185,175,245,163,231,225,195,132,243,219,143,187,168,197,102,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

King&amp;#039;s 2nd book called Quest for Zero Point Energy - Engineering Principles for Free Energy Inventions (2001) which includes many solutions for our energy problems we face each day. Raw scan, 215 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n\nAbout the Author\nMoray B. King is an internationally known physicist, author and speaker with specialities in on Zero-Point Energy, Tesla Technology and Quantum Physics.\n\nFrom a webreview:\nFree energy and anti-gravity are new solutions to the world&amp;#039;s energy crisis. Rarely mentioned in the media-- even as power shortages cripple the U.S.-- Zero-Point Energy can transform our earth to a self-sustaining, pollution-free planet. The basic theory of Zero Point Energy maintains that there are fluctuations of electrical field energy embedded within the fabric of space. By identifying the densest energy; and then using today&amp;#039;s technology to balance the energy flow, we can acquire free energy which doesn&amp;#039;t deplete the earth. Filled with detailed diagrams, patents, and photos, the chapters include: * Fundamentals of Zero-Point Energy Technology * Tapping Zero-Point Energy as an Energy Source * Vacuum Energy Vortices * The Super Tube * Charge Clusters \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba6c594256d11d12eb5626fc749217eea5ef91b3","amp;dn":"King-Quest+for+Zero+Point+Energy%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba6c594256d11d12eb5626fc749217eea5ef91b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,108,89,66,86,209,29,18,235,86,38,252,116,146,23,238,165,239,145,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

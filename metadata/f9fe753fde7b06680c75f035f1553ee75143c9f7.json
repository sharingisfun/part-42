It demystifies the process: from planting hops and fruits to pruning, harvesting, fermenting, flavoring, and bottling one-of-a-kind drinks from your own backyard. It serves as a starting point not only for wines and beers, but also hard ciders, meads, and infusions, and even touches on at-home distilling\n\n\nPerfect for the city-dweller, urban gardener, or anyone with limited space and a desire to make custom concoctions, Hooch offers projects to suit any lifestyle. With recipes for brews made from grapes, hops, and herbs, DIY boozers will find everything they need to begin a brewing journey.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my other Brewing Books, Zymurgy and BYO torrents\n                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&lt;/a&gt;\t(NOTE: If TPB keeps changing domains (ie... .org to .sx to .se), you will have to change it yourselves to see my other torrents)\t \n\n\n***************************************\n\t\t\t\nAlways looking for new brewing books digital or otherwise.

Kick is temporary and players are able to rejoin instantly, ban is set by the server host and can be for as long as you want. Press TAB to bring this menu up. \n\nFor weapon upgrading, it was never really clear how much faster or deadlier a weapon was getting when you stuck teeth and feathers to it, so weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve changed the display of the tool tip when you hover over weapon items. We now also display more information when placing items on the crafting mat about what effects the upgrade will have on the weapon stats. \n\nAxes will now align much better to cut point on tree, hopefully improving feel of tree cutting. \n\nYou can now put out lit fires by hitting them, added new player animation for opening book, we finally added option to lower texture resolution (this means we will eventually enable much higher resolution textures, but for now the option to go lower is available). \n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also fixed a bunch of bugs, added ability to place rocks in log sled, more balancing and cave layout/fixes, added some new art (some new cave wall types, club models), some new hidden story pickups, A bunch of new audio and way more fixes and tweaks all listed at: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://survivetheforest.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://survivetheforest.com&lt;/a&gt; and","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2379206e39a7bee3d55fba2d8b12f28f3630c0","amp;dn":"The+Forest+Public+Alpha+v24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2379206e39a7bee3d55fba2d8b12f28f3630c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,35,121,32,110,57,167,190,227,213,95,186,45,139,18,242,143,54,48,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

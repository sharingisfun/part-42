He ran, \nbut he couldn't run fast enough. Faster. Faster. The storm roaring on his \nheels. Faster. His heart, pounding. A banshee scream in his ears. \nFaster.... And a change exploded in him. Dark hairs burst from his hands \nand arms. He felt his spine contort, bowing his shoulders. \nHis hands---no longer hands---touched the earth. He ran faster, his body \nwhipsawing, and he began to rip from his clothes....&quot; \n\nIt is 1944. A message from Paris warns Allied Intelligence of something \nbig in the works---something which might have serious implications for \nD-Day. The only way to get more information from the agent in \nParis---now closely watched by the Gestapo---is to send in a personal \ncourier. \n\nRussian ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©migrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Michael Gallatin is picked for the job. In retirement as \na secret agent since a grisly episode in North Africa, Gallatin is \nparachuted into occupied France, on a mission which will take him to the \nfestering heart of the Third Reich on the scent of doomsday. \n\nAs a master spy, Gallatin has proved he can take on formidable foes---and \nkill them. As a passionate lover, he attracts beautiful women. But there \nis one extra factor which makes Michael Gallatin a unique special agent---he is a werewolf, able to change form almost at will, able to assume the body of a wolf and its capacity to kill with savage, snarling fury. \n\nIn the madness of war, Gallatin hunts his prey---ready to out-think his \nopponents with his finely-tuned brain. Or tear their throats out with his finely-honed teeth.... \n\nThe Wolf's Hour is a novel by Robert McCammon---master of horror \nfiction---which breaks the mold of the werewolf novel. It is a \nremarkable tale of pulse-pounding excitement and a fascinating, complex, \nand compelling portrayal of the werewolf as noble warrior and \nconflict-torn being. \n\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04baed0ed1956ad7a283b3de971dc3d4e49473ab","amp;dn":"Robert+McCammon+-+The+Wolf%5C%27s+Hour+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04baed0ed1956ad7a283b3de971dc3d4e49473ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,186,237,14,209,149,106,215,162,131,179,222,151,29,195,212,228,148,115,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

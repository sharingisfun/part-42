On this record Elvis Costello used musicians Ron Tutt (drums) Jerry Scheff (bass) and James Burton (guitar). All three also played in Elvis PresleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live band from 1970-1977.  James Burton, the man with the Pink Paisley Telecaster guitar, was also  a member of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Hot BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢- Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who not only backed up Elvis Presley live, and in the studio, beginning in 1969, but he also backed up Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris and Merle Haggard.  Elvis Costello recorded this at a live session at the Sound Factory in Hollywood.  Jimmy Cliff and the Ã¢â‚¬ËœEngine RoomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recorded in the same studio for JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœRebirthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album.  When I was producing the Jimmy Cliff record last year, I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but think about Ã¢â‚¬ËœKing Of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and how T Bone Burnett had all those guys play live in the studio, and how all those Ã¢â‚¬Å“engine roomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tracks we did, were done live in that same fantastic old room.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“On tv they prosecute anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excitingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the strongest Elvis Costello lyrics ever.\n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals, Guitar\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mandolin, Melodica, B3,  Rhodes, Acoustic Bass, Percussion\nMark Switzer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Banjo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c5a144f340df5add59b08661e77661098eded3","amp;dn":"American+Without+Tears+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c5a144f340df5add59b08661e77661098eded3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,197,161,68,243,64,223,90,221,89,176,134,97,231,118,97,9,142,222,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

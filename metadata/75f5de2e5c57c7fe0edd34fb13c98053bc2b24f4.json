P. Lovecraft. Written between March and August 1921, it was first published in Weird Tales, April 1926. In this work, a mysterious man who has been living alone in a castle for as long as he can remember decides to break free in search of human contact and light. &quot;The Outsider&quot; is one of Lovecraft's most commonly reprinted works and is also one of the most popular stories ever to be published in Weird Tales. &quot;The Outsider&quot; combines Horror, Fantasy, and Gothic Fiction to create a nightmarish story, containing themes of loneliness, the abhuman, and the afterlife.

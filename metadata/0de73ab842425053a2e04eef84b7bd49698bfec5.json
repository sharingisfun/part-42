If you do this, you will not need the CD-ROM reader to run them but you will need approximately 1.1 GB of additional disk space to store them.\n\nOperating System and Network Environments\n\nThis version of 757/767 Flight CBT can be installed and run in a Windows 95 environment.  At FlightSafety Boeing, we store it on an NT server, run it routinely on Windows 95 workstations, and have installed it on a Windows NT Workstation.\n\nInstalling it for use on several PCs running Windows 95 (or Windows NT Workstation) and connected to an NT server should be a straightforward task for anybody who is proficient at setting up applications in an NT LAN environment.  There are many ways NT LANs differ from one another and various ways to accomplish the installation.  Therefore, FlightSafety Boeing does not provide specific step-by-step instructions for such installations and does not train customers in these tasks.  Information and training regarding such systems and tasks is likely available from your LAN supplier.\n\nInformation about the Lessons\n\nOn this CD-ROM you will find a file called 56PMENU.DOC (for PIP FMC courses) or 56SMENUN.DOC (for Standard FMC courses) that lists the lessons, describes each lesson briefly, and tells the approximate time required to complete each lesson.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\tLesson\tRun Time\n\nCBT Introduction\t15 Minutes\n\n\tComputer-Based Training Operations\n\t\tProvides a general introduction to the CBT.

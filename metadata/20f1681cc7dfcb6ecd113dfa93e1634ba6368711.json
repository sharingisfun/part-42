Teaching this class, over time I saw what\nworks and what doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. This book is a distilled version of the Android Bootcamp\ntraining course that I developed at Marakana and fine-tuned over numerous\nengagements.\n\nMy background is in Java from back before it was even called that. From the beginning,\nI was very interested in embedded development as a way to program various devices\nthat surround us in everyday life. Because Java primarily took off in web application\ndevelopment, most of my experience in the previous decade has been in building large\nenterprise systems. Then Android arrived, and once again I became very excited about\nbuilding software for nontraditional computers. My current interests lie in using An-\ndroid on devices that may not even resemble a typical phone.\n\nThis book teaches anyone who knows Java (or a similar language) how to develop a\nreasonably complex Android application. I hope you find this book fairly comprehen-\nsive and that you find the example-based learning reasonably motivating. The goal of\nLearning Android is to get you to think in Android terms.\n\n\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inside\n\nChapter 1, Android Overview\nIs an introduction to Android and its history\n\nChapter 2, The Stack\nIs an overview of the Android operating system and all its parts from a very high\nlevel\n\nChapter 3, Quick Start\nHelps you set up your environment for Android application development\nChapter 4, Main Building Blocks\nExplains the Android components application developers use to put together an\napp\n\nChapter 5, Yamba Project Overview\nExplains the Yamba application that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll build together through this book and\nuse as an example to learn AndroidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s various features\n\nChapter 6, Android User Interface\nExplains how to build the user interface for your application\n\nChapter 7, Preferences, the Filesystem, the Options Menu, and Intents\nCovers some of the operating system features that make an application developerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nlife easier\n\nChapter 8, Services\nCovers building an Android service to process background tasks\n\nChapter 9, The Database\nExplains the Android frameworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support for the built-in SQLite database and\nhow to use it to persist the data in your own application\n\nChapter 10, Lists and Adapters\nCovers an important feature of Android that allows large data sets to be linked\nefficiently to relatively small screens\n\nChapter 11, Broadcast Receivers\nExplains how to use the publish-subscribe mechanism in Android to respond to\nvarious system and user-defined messages\n\nChapter 12, Content Providers\nShows how to design a content provider to share data between applications, in this\ncase using it to enable our app widget to display data on the home screen\n\nChapter 13, System Services\nIntroduces various system services that an app developer can tap into\n\nChapter 14, The Android Interface Definition Language\nCovers building an inter-process communication mechanism to allow for remote\naccess to a service from another application\n\nChapter 15, The Native Development Kit (NDK)\nIntroduces how to write native C code as part of your Android application\n\n\n\nBook Details :\n\nTitle : Learning Android\nPages : 268\nFormat : pdf\nSize : 10 Mb\nLanguage : English\n\n\nLike us on facebook...\n\n\nhttp:// www. facebook. com / torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f1681cc7dfcb6ecd113dfa93e1634ba6368711","amp;dn":"Learning+Android+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f1681cc7dfcb6ecd113dfa93e1634ba6368711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,241,104,28,199,223,203,110,205,17,61,250,147,225,99,75,166,54,135,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

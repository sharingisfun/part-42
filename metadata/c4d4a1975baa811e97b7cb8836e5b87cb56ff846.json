I recall it being played on studentparties from my friends, but to my ears it sounded way too soft in those days.\n\nThen again, I was so full of testosteron in my late teens that anything less heavy than Led Zeppelin, Van Halen or The Mahavishnu Orchestra I regarded as being girly music :)\n\nAs they say, wisdom and taste develop throught the years, so i gave it a second change and behold:  while many popjazz or jazzfunk outfits from the seventies sound quite corny nowadays this album has seriously stood the test of time. His guitar playing is just awesome and his supertight playing band really raises the spirits.\n\nHighly recommended by Breezin Himself ;) \n\nTracklisting\n01.\tWeekend In LA\n02.\tOn Broadway\n03.\tDown Here On The Ground\n04.\tCalifornia PM\n05.\tThe Greatest Love Of All\n06.\tIt's All In The Game\n07.\tWindsong\n08.\tOde To A Kudu\n09.\tLady Blue\n10.\tWe All Remember Wes\n11.\tWe As Love\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

Drawn with relaxed and beautiful brushwork, these strips perfectly capture the rhythm of daily life. From the hilarious to the sad, from the poetic to the drunken, these strips offer a direct and intimate portrait of the life of one of America's most important alternative cartoonists. This ambitious volume collects the first full year of Kochalka's diary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357912bbb7eab8781a453035aabbdc3802bca50b","amp;dn":"James+Kochalka+-+The+Sketchbook+Diaries+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357912bbb7eab8781a453035aabbdc3802bca50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,121,18,187,183,234,184,120,26,69,48,53,170,187,220,56,2,188,165,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

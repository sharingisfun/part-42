It is an ancient system in which physical and spiritual well-being comes from a number of sources, including a healthful diet based on oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s individual constitution.\n\nAyurveda is about achieving a physical and spiritual balance through a number of means, including yoga, aromatherapy, and diet. This all-vegetarian cookbook based on Ayurvedic traditions features delectable and nutritious recipes that appeal to particular doshas, which are oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal constitution based on physical and mental characteristics: fire (pitta), air (vata), and earth (kapha). (The book includes a dosha questionnaire so readers can determine their own.) And while the recipes are authentically Ayurvedic, they feature easy-to-find ingredients and modern-day cooking methods appropriate for busy schedules.\n\nThe book also includes yoga postures, cleansing programs, and information on aromatherapy, color therapy, and Abhyanga massage. There are also suggested meat substitutions for non-vegetarians. (Ayurveda is not exclusively vegetarian, although this book is.)\n\nWritten with both converts and beginners in mind, The Modern Ayurvedic Cookbook is a twenty-first-century approach to a five-thousand-year-old tradition that will restore your health, energy, and sense of well-being.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c8c83c2461f5e0fa612cf2402c4714682d046a","amp;dn":"The+Modern+Ayurvedic+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c8c83c2461f5e0fa612cf2402c4714682d046a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,200,200,60,36,97,245,224,250,97,44,242,64,44,71,20,104,45,4,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

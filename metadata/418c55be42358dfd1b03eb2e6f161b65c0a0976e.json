The band's second and last self-produced album, it was also the first AC/DC album since the original Australian version of High Voltage not to include drummer Phil Rudd, who was replaced by Simon Wright (although Wright appeared in music videos for Flick of the Switch tracks.) \n\nLike their previous album, Flick of the Switch, Angus and Malcolm Young chose to produce in order to capture the rawness and simplicity of their early works in a time when pop-oriented glam metal became popular.\n\nThe album was not well received by critics and only sold one million copies upon its release, as opposed to the success of their previous albums, Back in Black and For Those About to Rock We Salute You. The singles &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot; and &quot;Sink the Pink&quot;, however, are seen as standouts from the album, and both songs were later included on the band's soundtrack album Who Made Who for Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Fly on the Wall&quot;   \t  3:44\n2. \t&quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;  4:10\n3. \t&quot;First Blood&quot;   \t  3:46\n4. \t&quot;Danger&quot;   \t          4:22\n5. \t&quot;Sink the Pink&quot;   \t  4:15\n6. \t&quot;Playing with Girls&quot;   \t  3:44\n7. \t&quot;Stand Up&quot;   \t          3:53\n8. \t&quot;Hell or High Water&quot;      4:32\n9. \t&quot;Back in Business&quot;   \t  4:24\n10. \t&quot;Send for the Man&quot;   \t  3:36\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:418c55be42358dfd1b03eb2e6f161b65c0a0976e","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1985+-+Fly+On+The+Wall+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"418c55be42358dfd1b03eb2e6f161b65c0a0976e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,140,85,190,66,53,141,253,27,3,235,46,111,22,27,101,192,160,151,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
